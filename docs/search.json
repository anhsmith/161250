    "text": "Fitting an ANOVA model\nAn ANOVA model is fit in R using the function aov(). There is a function anova(), but this instead can be used to produce an ANOVA table from an existing model (we saw use of this in Chapter 7).\nLet’s do it.\n\n\nCode\naov(count ~ spray, data = IS)\n\n\nCall:\n   aov(formula = count ~ spray, data = IS)\n\nTerms:\n                   spray Residuals\nSum of Squares  2668.833  1015.167\nDeg. of Freedom        5        66\n\nResidual standard error: 3.921902\nEstimated effects may be unbalanced\n\n\nThis shows the among-groups (spray) and within-groups (Residuals) sum of squares, and degrees of freedom. The Residual standard error is the square root of the error variance (\\(\\sigma_\\varepsilon^2\\)). It is the expected (average) absolute deviation from the individual data points to their respective group means. If required, you can remind yourself what these values represent from the lecture slides.\nWe can get the full ANOVA table by commanding a summary() of an aov object. (Note, a very similar output can be achieved by applying the anova() function to an aov object.)\n\n\nCode\naov(count ~ spray, data=IS) |&gt; summary()\n\n\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F)    \nspray        5   2669   533.8    34.7 &lt;2e-16 ***\nResiduals   66   1015    15.4                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe full ANOVA table also gives us the Mean Squares (the SS divided by their respective df), the F value (the ratio of the within-to-among-groups Mean Squares), and the P-value.\nThe null hypothesis tested here is that there is no difference between the group means in the population.\n\\[H_0 : \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = ... = \\mu_g\\]\nThe alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the groups is different to the others.\nRemember that we assume that we have taken a sample of data at random from a population. The P-value is the proportion of equivalent samples in which we would obtain the observed test statistic or greater if the null hypothesis is true (i.e. no difference among groups). In other words, how likely is it that the observed differences among means have occurred just through chance? Here, the F ratio is high and P-value is tiny (&lt; 0.0000000000000002). So, there is extremely strong evidence against the null hypothesis and we can conclude that there is indeed a difference among the group means—plants subjected to different types of spray have, on average, different numbers of insects on them.\nThis, in itself, is not immensely informative. Naturally, we wish to examine which groups (spray types) are different from one another.\nBut, first, we need to examine our assumptions."

    "text": "Examining the assumptions of ANOVA\nLike for regression, diagnostic plots are the first step for examining how well the assumptions of ANOVA are met by our model. If these assumptions are not met, then the F-ratio might not behave as it should (i.e. follow an F-distribution) with repeated sampling under a true null hypothesis.\nThose assumptions are:\n\nAppropriateness of an additive linear model\nIndependent errors\nNormally distributed errors\nHomogeneity of errors\n\nWe will focus on 3 and 4 because 1 and 2 cannot really be checked at this stage of the analysis.\nLet’s make the plots.\n\n\nCode\nplot(aov(count ~ spray, data=IS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is cause for concern here. As is often the case with counts, there seems to be some heteroscedasticity in the residuals. That is, the residual variance does not appear constant, but rather increases with the fitted value. In an ANOVA context, this means that the groups with high means have greater within-group variation. Let’s have a look at the standard deviations of the groups.\n\n\nCode\nIS |&gt; group_by(spray) |&gt; summarise(sd = sd(count))\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  spray    sd\n  &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 A      4.72\n2 B      4.27\n3 C      1.98\n4 D      2.50\n5 E      1.73\n6 F      6.21\n\n\nIndeed, there is a huge difference between the largest and smallest standard deviation (roughly 3.5-fold).\nWe can use a Levene’s test to explicitly test for evidence of heterogeneous variances. The function leveneTest() in the car package does this. Remember, the null hypothesis is that the average absolute deviations are the same in all groups.\n\n\nCode\ncar::leveneTest(aov(count ~ spray, data=IS))\n\n\nLevene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median)\n      Df F value   Pr(&gt;F)   \ngroup  5  3.8214 0.004223 **\n      66                    \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe low P-value here indicates that the null hypothesis is rejected and our suspicions were correct—there are significant differences in the variations among groups.\nThe assumption of normality also seems suspect here, according to the fact that many data do not fall along the dotted line in the Q-Q plot. This is probably part of the same problem.\nWe can try transforming the response variable count and see if that helps."

    "text": "Interaction\nFirst, we look at the interaction Temperature:Salinity. It is highly significant and the most important source of explained variation in the model. This was abundantly clear when we plotted Growth according to both factors simultaneously. The mean lines on the plot were not parallel, which is indicative of an interaction.\nTemperature and Salinity have an effect on Growth but they are no independent. The effect of Temperature on Growth depends on Salinity, and the effect of Salinity on Growth depends on Temperature.\nWithout taking Salinity into account, Temperature has no apparent effect. For low Salinity environments, growth increases with increasing Temperature. For high Salinity, the opposite is true: Growth decreases with increasing Temperature.\nThere is an important lesson to be learned here. A variable that is important for explaining variation in the response, but not included in the model, can obfuscate the relationship between the response and the variables that you have included, particularly when interactions are present.\nSo-called ‘latent’ variables cause problems in science. This highlights the importance of knowing all the important causes of variation in a measured response. Two strategies may then be employed. You can hold a variable constant (e.g., examine temperature in medium salinity environments) but this restricts the inference space of your conclusions (they would only be valid for medium salinity). Alternatively, you can include a variable in the design (or measure it if it is not easily manipulated), ensuring that it is accounted for in any analyses.\nAnother potential consequence of an unknown latent variable is excess dispersion in some groups. This resulted in a significant departure from group homogeneity in the Levene’s test for both Salinity and Temperature when the other was left out.\nAnother thing to note is that, when the interaction is significant, we don’t need to worry about the main effects of the two factors."

The difference is only 0.46, however, and we know that this comparison does not represent the real effects of temperature on growth. It is marginalised over salinity, whereas we now know that the most important effects of temperature are, in fact, conditional on salinity.\nFor the interaction comparisons, 13 out of 15 are significantly different. You should refer to the interaction plot on the previous page (or on your screen) to make some sense of which of the comparisons are large or small. For example, the first line gives the comparison between the low-salinity-low-temperature group and the high-salinity-low-temperature group (i.e. the two groups to the left of the interaction plot above). It is one of the largest absolute differences and is highly significant. The greatest difference is on the ninth line of the interaction comparisons: low-salinity-high-temperature vs low-salinity-low-temperature (i.e., those at opposite ends of the low-salinity line on the interaction plot).\nWe can also plot the comparisons and corresponding Tukey intervals. The which argument allows you to restrict the output to particular terms (here, the interaction).\n\n\nCode\ntuk &lt;- aov(Growth~Salinity*Temperature, data=oys) |&gt; \n    TukeyHSD(which = \"Salinity:Temperature\")\n\npar(mar=c(5,10,3,1)) # adjust the margins so you can read the labels\nplot(tuk, las = 1)"

Just from including another (potentially competing) predictor in the model! Take a moment to consider how this might have happened.\nThe key here is the decrease in the residual SS from 156 to 97. The F-ratio is calculated from the treatment SS divided by the residual SS. Therefore, if you decrease the residual SS, you can increase the value of F. By attributing variation to a covariate, it is no longer considered to be part of the random, unexplained variation.

We can see that the p-values for the F-test and the t-test for the regression coefficient (\\(\\beta\\)) are the same: we can conclude that temperature has a highly significant effect on the frequency of chirps, accounting for around 70% of the variation. For every degree increase in temperature, the number of chirps per second is expected to increase by 0.38.\nWe cannot just stop there, however. We need to examine the model and check the assumptions.\nPlot the data again, this time with a linear regression line.\n\n\nCode\nch |&gt; \n  ggplot() + \n  aes(degC, chirps) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(\n    intercept = 6.47246,\n    slope = 0.38146\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also use the function predict() to extract the fitted values, with confidence or prediction intervals for each data point.\n\n\nCode\npredict(chm, interval=\"confidence\")\n\n\n        fit      lwr      upr\n1  18.46741 17.56955 19.36527\n2  14.86469 13.97481 15.75457\n3  19.46346 18.22919 20.69773\n4  17.55613 16.90760 18.20467\n5  16.77201 16.22807 17.31595\n6  15.62762 14.95122 16.30401\n7  14.46203 13.44151 15.48254\n8  17.06871 16.50254 17.63487\n9  14.39845 13.35659 15.44031\n10 17.34421 16.73758 17.95084\n11 16.56009 16.01692 17.10325\n12 17.19586 16.61319 17.77854\n13 16.77201 16.22807 17.31595\n14 17.38659 16.77226 18.00093\n15 15.86073 15.23503 16.48644\n\n\nThis gives the predictions for each of the original data points, along with and interval in which the mean prediction lies with 95% confidence (i.e., if we took many many samples and fit a regression model to each, 95% of so-constructed confidence intervals will include the true mean of \\(Y\\) for this value of \\(X\\)).\nThis is not to be confused with a “prediction” interval, which is expected to contain 95% of the actual values of \\(Y\\) for this value of \\(X\\), rather than the mean value.

It is an interval in which the mean of Y, for a given value of X, is expected to lie with 95% confidence.\nA 95% prediction interval is an interval in which 95% of Y values are expected to lie for a given value of X. Prediction intervals are broader than confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n\n\nPredicting for new data\nYou can also use the model to make predictions for new values of \\(X\\). To do this, first create a data frame object with a column of the same name as the \\(X\\) variable used in the model (i.e., degC), and then enter this object as the newdata argument for the predict function.\n\n\nCode\nnewdat &lt;- data.frame(degC = 20:34)\nprednew &lt;- predict(chm, newdata = newdat, interval = \"confidence\")\nprednew\n\n\n        fit      lwr      upr\n1  14.10176 12.95828 15.24524\n2  14.48322 13.46978 15.49666\n3  14.86469 13.97481 15.75457\n4  15.24615 14.47024 16.02206\n5  15.62762 14.95122 16.30401\n6  16.00908 15.41049 16.60767\n7  16.39055 15.83880 16.94230\n8  16.77201 16.22807 17.31595\n9  17.15348 16.57674 17.73022\n10 17.53494 16.89096 18.17892\n11 17.91641 17.18012 18.65269\n12 18.29787 17.45239 19.14335\n13 18.67934 17.71348 19.64520\n14 19.06080 17.96707 20.15454\n15 19.44227 18.21550 20.66903\n\n\nThese correspond to the predicted means and confidence intervals for \\(Y\\), for \\(X\\) values of 20 to 34.\n\n\nPlotting confidence intervals\nWe can automatically plot confidence intervals for a linear fit like so:\n\n\nCode\nch |&gt; \n  ggplot() + \n  aes(degC, chirps) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOr with the visreg package.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(visreg)\n\nvisreg(chm, gg=T)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the mean is most certain (i.e., the interval is tighter) around the centre of the data and less so around the extremes.\n\n\nResidual plots\nThe linear regression model looks like it provides a reasonable fit to the data. We should just check the residuals though.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  aes(chm$fitted.values, chm$residuals) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember, you want a complete mess in your residual plot—no pattern is good pattern. We generally look for two things: heteroscedasticity and trend. We can see in the plot above that the residuals appear to have quite a constant variance, so no worries about the heteroscedasticity there. However, there is a hint of a trend—there are more points above zero at low and high fitted values, and more below the line at middle fitted values. This is not too severe, but it warrants further consideration.\nUsing the function plot() on an lm object gives four very useful diagnostic graphs. You can read about them in the help file by entering the following.\n\n\nCode\nplot(chm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting R’s diagnostic plots\n\n\n\nThe diagnostic plots are designed to inform the user of any departure from the assumptions of a linear model.\nThe Residuals vs Fitted plot shows the regular residuals, i.e., the difference between the observed and fitted values on the y-axis plotted against the fitted values on the x-axis. Ideally, this would show a complete trend-less mess. Here, there is a little curvature on the plot, which may concern us a little.\nThe Normal Q-Q plot compares the residuals with their expected values if they were normally distributed. When lots of points lie away from this line, then there is evidence that the residuals are non-normally distributed, which violates an assumption of linear models. Here, they look pretty good. A little departure from the line at the very ends is common, and no cause for great concern.\nThe Scale-Location plot shows the square-root of the standardised residuals (i.e. divided by their standard deviation) against the predicted values. This can be used to look for heteroscedasticity—changes in the variance of the residuals for different fitted values—which is also an assumption of linear models. Ideally, there would be no trend in these points and the red line would be perfectly horizontal. It doesn’t look bad here.\nFinally, the Residuals vs Leverage plot shows the standardised residuals against Leverage. The leverage measures the potential influence a point has given the extremeness of its values for the predictor variable. If a point has large leverage and a large residual, then it will have large influence, meaning that it is having a large effect on the estimated parameters. So, this plot is useful for identifying outliers and influential points. Any points that are outside the red dashed lines have high values of Cook’s D reflecting a large influence on the estimates a and b, and are therefore potentially cause for concern. So, ideally, there would be no points outside the dashed lines.\n\n\nThe only problem we can see in the diagnostic plots is in the residuals-vs-fitted one, where there’s a bit of curvature, as identified by the red smoother line. Otherwise, the residuals are fairly normal (Q-Q) and with constant variance (scale-location).\nFrom the plots above, it looks like there may be little effect of temperature on chirps below, say, 23 degrees. Let’s fit this model again, this time removing the three data points below this temperature.\n\n\nCode\nchmsub &lt;- lm(chirps ~ degC, data=ch, subset = degC &gt; 23)\n\nsummary(chmsub)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = chirps ~ degC, data = ch, subset = degC &gt; 23)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1.05254 -0.60559 -0.05311  0.75837  1.07639 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)  0.86776    2.48526   0.349    0.734    \ndegC         0.57421    0.08821   6.509 6.81e-05 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 0.7998 on 10 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.8091,    Adjusted R-squared:   0.79 \nF-statistic: 42.37 on 1 and 10 DF,  p-value: 6.815e-05\n\n\nWe now see that if we exclude those points, thus restricting our model to only those times where the temperature is greater than 23°C, we now explain 81% of the variation. The estimated per-degree increase in chirping has gone from 0.38 to 0.57, indicating a much stronger effect.\nLet’s have a look at the diagnostic plots.\n\n\nCode\nplot(chmsub)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residuals seem to be a bit better behaved now. Certainly the trend identified in the previous model has disappeared. The smoother lines might look a little wild at first glance, but this is probably just because the dataset is small. I see no real cause for concern.\nNow plot the new model with confidence intervals.\n\n\nCode\n  ggplot() + \n  aes(degC, chirps) +\n  geom_point(\n    data = ch, \n    aes(colour = degC &gt; 23)\n    ) +\n  geom_smooth(\n    method = \"lm\", \n    data = ch |&gt; filter(degC &gt; 23),\n    colour = 1\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks like a much better model overall. Perhaps we can conclude that above approximately 23 degrees, chirping increases linearly with temperature.\nIt is important to note that subsetting the data in this way changes the inference space to which the model applies. The chmsub model should not be used to predict chirps for temperatures less than 23°C (or greater than 34°C, for that matter). A model should only be used within the range of values spanned by the data used to create it. Beyond this range, it will very likely be wrong. Our exclusion of the sub-23° data therefore further restricts the range of values for which this model may be used."

    "text": "Setting up a Quarto project\nIt is a good idea to get into the habit of using Quarto projects, rather than just R scripts. Here is a step-by-step guide to creating a project for your workshops. You don’t have to use projects, but they are very useful.\n\nOpen RStudio. (Optional: click on the little window symbol at the top and select “Console on Right”)\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t already, make a directory on your computer where you want to keep your code for this course.\nMake a new project. Select the “Project” button at the top-right of Rstudio, and select “New Project…”.\n\n\n\nIn the pop-up window:\n\n\nSelect “New Directory”\n\n\n\nSelect “Quarto Project”\n\n\n\nChoose your directory via the “Browse”, and then give the project a name like “161250_workshops”\n\n\n\nFinish by clicking on “Create Project”.\n\nThe project should now be created, and you’ll likely have an open *.qmd file (something like “161250_workshops.qmd”) in the top-right window of Rstudio. We want to make a *.qmd file for this workshop.\n\nRight-click on the qmd tab and select “Rename”, and rename it “workshop2.qmd” or something similar. (Alternatively, just make a new file via the menus: File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document.)\n\n\nNow you have a document for your Workshop 2 work. You can:\n\nWrite headings with lines beginning with “#”.\nWrite text in the main part of the document.\nMake a code chunk for your R code using Ctrl-Alt-i. Write R code in the code chunks.\n\nLike so:\n\nThere are lots of tutorials online covering the basics of Quarto, and we’ll discuss them during our own workshops. Here are a couple for starters:\nhttps://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c654j7aQjcg\nThere are many advantages of Quarto projects. One is that you can put datasets into the project folder, and they’ll be easily accessible within your project, without having to worry about file paths.\nYou can easily open a recent past projects via the “Projects” button on the top-right of Rstudio.\n\n\nDataset Prestige\nAs you work through this workshop, you can copy the code and paste it into a code chunk. Write notes and observations to your self as you go.\nWe will be using a well-known dataset called Prestige from the car R package. This dataset deals with prestige ratings of Canadian occupations. The Prestige dataset has 102 rows and 6 columns. Each row (or ‘observation’) is an occupation.\nThis data frame contains the following columns:\n\neducation - Average education of occupational incumbents, years, in 1971.\nincome - Average income of incumbents, dollars, in 1971.\nwomen - Percentage of incumbents who are women.\nprestige - Pineo-Porter prestige score for occupation, from a social survey conducted in the mid-1960s.\ncensus - Canadian Census occupational code.\ntype - Type of occupation. A factor with levels: bc, Blue Collar; prof, Professional, Managerial, and Technical; wc, White Collar. (includes four missing values).\n\nFirst we’ll load the data. The dataset sits in the car package, so you need to load the car package first.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(car)\ndata(Prestige)\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.1\nDraw a bar chart for type. These plots show the count or relative frequency of blue collar (bc), professional (prof), and white collar (wc) professions in the dataset.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\np &lt;- Prestige |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  aes(type) + \n  geom_bar()\n\np\n\n\nOr with plotly (which works for HTML, not for PDF)\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(plotly)\n\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr with old-style R plot\n\n\nCode\n# or\nlibrary(car)\nbarplot(table(Prestige$type))\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.2\nDraw a histogram of prestige.\nBelow demonstrates the flexibility of ggplot code. You can specify the data argument by piping it into ggplot, or by putting it as an argument to ggplot or a geom_. Likewise, the mapping or aes information, which determines which variables are used where, can be added as an extra line or specified inside the ggplot or geom_ function.\n\n\nCode\nPrestige |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  aes(x = prestige) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\nNow, this histogram, where the number of bins has been chosen for us, looks a bit “spiky” to my eye. You can control the number of bins by adding an argument bins = 10.\n\n\nCode\nPrestige |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  aes(x = prestige) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=10)\n\n\nggplot is very flexible as to where you put the data and the aes information; all of these methods give the same result.\n\n\nCode\nPrestige |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  aes(x = prestige) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=10)\n\n\nCode\nggplot(\n  data = Prestige,\n  mapping = aes(x = prestige)\n  ) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=10)\n\n\nCode\nggplot(Prestige) +\n  aes(x = prestige) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=10) \n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(\n    data = Prestige,\n    mapping = aes(x = prestige),\n    bins = 10\n    )\n\n\nCode\n# or\n# library(plotly)\n# p &lt;- Prestige |&gt; \n#   ggplot() +\n#   aes(prestige) +\n#   geom_histogram(bins=10)\n# \n# ggplotly(p)\n\n# or\n# hist(Prestige$prestige)\n\n\nNow let’s display the prestige scores for each profession as a dot plot.\nNote that I’m including the code-chunk option #| fig-height: 12 at the beginning of my code chunk so that the plot is big enough to show all the professions without overlap.\n\n\nCode\nPrestige |&gt;\n  ggplot() + \n  aes(x = rownames(Prestige), y = prestige) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a mess!\nWe can tidy it up by ordering the professions on the plot according to prestige. First, we move the professions from rownames to a variable. Then, we fct_reorder the professions using the prestige scores. Then, the resulting data gets piped into ggplot.\n\n\nCode\nPrestige |&gt; \n  rownames_to_column(var = \"profession\") |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    profession = fct_reorder(profession, prestige)\n    ) |&gt;\n  ggplot() + \n  aes(x = profession, y = prestige, colour = type) +\n  geom_point() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.3\nObtain some summary statistics for prestige. There are a few options for this.\n\n\nCode\nsummary(Prestige)\n\n\n   education          income          women           prestige    \n Min.   : 6.380   Min.   :  611   Min.   : 0.000   Min.   :14.80  \n 1st Qu.: 8.445   1st Qu.: 4106   1st Qu.: 3.592   1st Qu.:35.23  \n Median :10.540   Median : 5930   Median :13.600   Median :43.60  \n Mean   :10.738   Mean   : 6798   Mean   :28.979   Mean   :46.83  \n 3rd Qu.:12.648   3rd Qu.: 8187   3rd Qu.:52.203   3rd Qu.:59.27  \n Max.   :15.970   Max.   :25879   Max.   :97.510   Max.   :87.20  \n     census       type   \n Min.   :1113   bc  :44  \n 1st Qu.:3120   prof:31  \n Median :5135   wc  :23  \n Mean   :5402   NA's: 4  \n 3rd Qu.:8312            \n Max.   :9517            \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(psych)\n\ndescribe(Prestige)\n\n\n          vars   n    mean      sd  median trimmed     mad     min      max\neducation    1 102   10.74    2.73   10.54   10.63    3.15    6.38    15.97\nincome       2 102 6797.90 4245.92 5930.50 6161.49 3060.83  611.00 25879.00\nwomen        3 102   28.98   31.72   13.60   24.74   18.73    0.00    97.51\nprestige     4 102   46.83   17.20   43.60   46.20   19.20   14.80    87.20\ncensus       5 102 5401.77 2644.99 5135.00 5393.87 4097.91 1113.00  9517.00\ntype*        6  98    1.79    0.80    2.00    1.74    1.48    1.00     3.00\n             range skew kurtosis     se\neducation     9.59 0.32    -1.03   0.27\nincome    25268.00 2.13     6.29 420.41\nwomen        97.51 0.90    -0.68   3.14\nprestige     72.40 0.33    -0.79   1.70\ncensus     8404.00 0.11    -1.49 261.89\ntype*         2.00 0.40    -1.36   0.08\n\n\nCode\ndescribeBy(education + income + women + prestige ~ type, \n           data = Prestige)\n\n\n\n Descriptive statistics by group \ntype: bc\n          vars  n    mean      sd  median trimmed     mad     min     max\neducation    1 44    8.36    1.16    8.35    8.32    1.14    6.38   10.93\nincome       2 44 5374.14 2004.33 5216.50 5338.56 2275.05 1656.00 8895.00\nwomen        3 44   18.97   26.15    4.72   14.48    7.01    0.00   90.67\nprestige     4 44   35.53   10.02   35.90   35.46   11.34   17.30   54.90\n            range skew kurtosis     se\neducation    4.55 0.34    -0.76   0.18\nincome    7239.00 0.17    -1.00 302.16\nwomen       90.67 1.36     0.51   3.94\nprestige    37.60 0.05    -1.03   1.51\n------------------------------------------------------------ \ntype: prof\n          vars  n     mean      sd  median trimmed     mad     min      max\neducation    1 31    14.08    1.39   14.44   14.16    1.22   11.09    15.97\nincome       2 31 10559.45 5422.82 8865.00 9700.04 3955.58 4614.00 25879.00\nwomen        3 31    25.51   28.37   11.68   21.03   13.86    0.58    96.12\nprestige     4 31    67.85    8.68   68.40   67.34    9.19   53.80    87.20\n             range  skew kurtosis     se\neducation     4.88 -0.47    -0.93   0.25\nincome    21265.00  1.37     1.36 973.97\nwomen        95.54  1.14    -0.04   5.09\nprestige     33.40  0.36    -0.67   1.56\n------------------------------------------------------------ \ntype: wc\n          vars  n    mean      sd  median trimmed     mad     min     max\neducation    1 23   11.02    0.92   11.13   11.03    0.68    9.17   12.79\nincome       2 23 5052.30 1944.32 4741.00 4960.53 2342.51 2448.00 8780.00\nwomen        3 23   52.83   33.11   56.10   53.19   47.77    3.16   97.51\nprestige     4 23   42.24    9.52   41.50   41.61    8.60   26.50   67.50\n            range  skew kurtosis     se\neducation    3.62 -0.20    -0.27   0.19\nincome    6332.00  0.44    -1.18 405.42\nwomen       94.35 -0.10    -1.58   6.90\nprestige    41.00  0.63     0.18   1.98\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.4\nMake a boxplot of prestige ~ type:\n\n\nCode\nPrestige |&gt;

    "text": "“Statistics is the grammar of science.”\n— Karl Pearson\nIn this course, principles and techniques will be considered of collecting, displaying, and analysing data. The Study Guide covers the basic types of sets of numbers, namely single batches, two or more batches, related batches and data in tables. It contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques for displaying data, fitting a model, and considering transformations of variables so that the data better fit the assumptions of the models. The Study Guide also contains some methods for testing hypotheses, namely \\(t\\), \\(F\\) and \\(\\chi^2\\) tests; and some thoughts on the collection data.\nThe essence of Exploratory Data Analysis, or EDA, is to search for clues by whatever graphical or numerical means seem appropriate and even though these methods are often easy to understand, it is useful to have a computer at hand to perform the computations and draw graphs. Methods for EDA have developed very quickly over the past few decades. John Tukey (1977) likened EDA to detective work where data are studied carefully to provide clues. Some of the techniques employed are quite old and date back to the nineteenth century and beyond when researchers collected information in an organised way and displayed it in tables and graphs. Other techniques are of more recent origin and have been developed to more easily discern peculiarities and trends in data and to provide robust methods of fitting models to data, and these methods not being overly sensitive to restrictive assumptions.\nInferential statistics1 has also seen huge progress in the last 50 or so years since we’ve had fast computers. Inference uses probability models to test hypotheses and estimate parameters while quantifying uncertainty. These procedures lie at the heart of all quantitative science, and can be likened to the way a detective evaluates evidence for competing theories. Regression and Analysis of Variance models are covered in the later part of the study guide, where we will use both EDA and inferential statistics. Topics such as time series analysis, nonparametric methods, and experimental design are presented only briefly. It is intended that these sections will give you an idea of how advanced modelling or analysis can be done.\nNote that you are not expected to study all the topics in depth. Some sections of the study guide are intended for revision of the topics you studied in a first year statistics course. Some topics such as experimental design, correspondence analysis etc will not be examined in depth.\nData analysis is best learned by practice—exploring, summarising, plotting, and testing ideas with real data. Reading a textbook or study guide on data analysis is important, but this activity is more like reading a cook book. In the words of John Tukey:"

    "text": "Significance testing of Type I SS\nThe significance of the additional variation explained by a predictor can be tested using a \\(t\\) or \\(F\\) statistic. Consider the simple regression model of WEIGHT on EXTDIA. Suppose we decided to add the explanatory variable OUTERDIA to the model, i.e. regress WEIGHT on two explanatory variables EXTDIA and OUTERDIA. Is this new model a significant improvement on the existing one? For testing the null hypothesis that the true slope coefficient of OUTERDIA in this model is zero, the \\(t\\)-statistic is 1.531 (see output below).\n\n\nCode\ntwovar.model &lt;- lm(WEIGHT~ EXTDIA+OUTERDIA, data=horsehearts)\n\ntwovar.model |&gt; tidy()\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)   -1.97     0.551      -3.57 0.000885\n2 EXTDIA         0.226    0.0614      3.68 0.000637\n3 OUTERDIA       0.522    0.341       1.53 0.133   \n\n\nThe \\(t\\) and \\(F\\) distributions are related by the equation \\(t^{2} =F\\) when the numerator df is just one for the \\(F\\) statistic. Hence 1.532 = 2.34 is the \\(F\\) value for testing the significance of the additional SSR due to OUTERDIA. In other words, the addition of OUTERDIA to the simple regression model does not result in a significant improvement in the sense that the reduction in residual SS (= 1.247) as measured by the \\(F\\) value of 2.34 is not significant (\\(p\\)-value being 0.133).\n\n\nCode\nonevar.model &lt;- lm(WEIGHT~ EXTDIA, data=horsehearts)\n\ntwovar.model &lt;- lm(WEIGHT~ EXTDIA+OUTERDIA, data=horsehearts)\n\nanova(onevar.model, twovar.model)\n\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: WEIGHT ~ EXTDIA\nModel 2: WEIGHT ~ EXTDIA + OUTERDIA\n  Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq      F Pr(&gt;F)\n1     44 24.115                           \n2     43 22.867  1    1.2472 2.3453  0.133\n\n\nAlthough OUTERDIA is correlated with WEIGHT, it also has high correlation with EXTDIA. In other words, the correlation matrix gives us some indication of how many variables might be needed in a multiple regression model, although by itself it cannot tell us what combination of predictor variables is good or best.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Issues with multiple predictors\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Effect of multiple predictors on model summaries\n\n\nFigure 5 and Figure 6 summarise the following facts:\n\nWhen there is only one explanatory variable, \\(R^2\\) = SSR/SST equals the square of the correlation coefficient between that variable and the dependent variable. Therefore if only one variable is to be chosen, it should have the highest correlation with the response variable, \\(Y\\).\nWhen variables are added to a model, the regression sum of squares SSR will increase and the residual or error sum of squares SSE will reduce. The opposite is true if variables are dropped from the model. This fact follows from Figure 6.\nThe other side of the coin to the above remark is that as additional variables are added, the Sums of Squares for residuals, SSE, will decrease towards zero as also shown in Figure 6(c).\nThe overlap of circles in suggests that these changes in both SSR and SST will lessen as more variables are added, see Figure 5(b).\nFollowing on from the last two notes, as \\(R^2\\) = SSR/SST, \\(R^2\\) will increase monotonically towards 1 as additional variables are added to the model. (monotonically increasing means that it never decreases although it could remain the same). This is indicated by Figure 6(a). If variables are dropped, then \\(R^2\\) will monotonically decrease.\nAgainst the above trends, the graph of residual mean square in Figure 6(b) reduces to a minimum but may eventually start to increase if enough variables are added. The residual sum of squares SSE decreases as variables are added to the model (see Figure 5(b)). However, the associated df values also decrease so that the residual standard deviation decreases at first and then starts to increase as shown in Figure 6(b). (Note that the residual standard error \\(s_{e}\\) is the square root of the residual mean square\n\\[s_{e}^{2} =\\frac{{\\text {SSE}}}{{\\text {error degrees of freedom}}},\\]\ndenoted as MSE in Figure 5(b)). After a number of variables have been entered, the additional amount of variation explained by them slows down but the degrees of freedom continues to change by 1 for every variable added, resulting in the eventual increase in residual mean square. Note that the graphs in Figure 5 are idealised ones. For some data sets, the behaviour of residual mean square may not be monotone.\nNotice that the above trends will occur even if the variables added are garbage. For example, you could generate a column of random data or a column of birthdays of your friends, and this would improve the \\(R^2\\) but not the adjusted \\(R^2\\). The adjusted \\(R^2\\) makes adjustment for the degrees of freedom for the SSR and SSE, and hence reliable when compared to the unadjusted or multiple \\(R^2\\). The residual mean square error also partly adjusts for the drop in the degrees of freedom for the SSE and hence becomes an important measure. The addition of unimportant variables will not improve the adjusted \\(R^2\\) and the mean square error \\(s_{e}^{2}\\)."

    "text": "Best Subsets Selection\nAn exhaustive screening of all possible regression models (and hence the name best subsets regression) can also be done using software. For example, there are 6 predictor variables in the horses’ hearts data. If we fix the number of predictors as 3, then \\(\\small {\\left(\\begin{array}{c} {6} \\\\ {3} \\end{array}\\right)} = 20\\) regression models are possible. One may select the ‘best’ 3-variable model based on criteria such as AIC, \\(C_{p}\\), \\(R_{adj}^{2}\\) etc. Software must be employed to perform the conventional stepwise regression procedures. Software algorithms give one or more best candidate models fixing the number of variables in each step.\nOn the basis of our analysis on the horses’ hear data, we might decide to recommend the model with predictor variables EXTDIA, EXTSYS, INNERDIA and OUTERSYS. In particular if the model is to be used for describing relationships then we would tend to include more variables. For prediction purposes, however, a simpler feasible model is preferred and in this case we may opt for the smaller model with only INNERDIA and OUTERSYS.

If this variable is found to make an insignificant contribution to the model, then one should exclude the variable when the model is to be used for prediction but if the model is to be used for explanation purposes only then the variable should be included. Other considerations such as cost and time may also be taken into account. For every method or algorithm, one could find peculiar data sets where it fouls up. The moral – be alert and don’t automatically accept models thrown up by a program. Note there is never one right answer as different methods and different criteria lead to different models.\nVariable selection procedures can be a valuable tool in data analysis, particularly in the early stages of building a model. At the same time, they present certain dangers. There are several reasons for this:\n\nThese procedures automatically snoop though many models and may select ones which, by chance, happen to fit well.\nThese forward or backward stepwise procedures are heuristic (i.e., shortcut) algorithms, which often work very well but which may not always select the best model for a given number of predictors (here best may refer to adjusted \\(R^2\\)-values, or AIC or some other criterion).\nAutomatic procedures cannot take into account special knowledge the analyst may have about the data. Therefore, the model selected may not be the best (or make sense) from a practical point of view.\nMethods are available that shrink coefficients towards zero. The least squares approach minimises the residual sums of squares or RSS without placing any constraint on the coefficients. The shrinkage methods, which place a constraint on the coefficients, work well when there are large numbers of predictors. A ridge regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero but in relation each other. On the other hand, (Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator) lasso regression shrinks some of coefficients to zero which means these predictors can be dropped. Note that the ridge regression does not completely remove predictors. By shrinking large coefficients, we obtain a model with higher bias but lower variance. This process is known as regularisation in the literature (not covered in this course)."

    "text": "Goodness of Fit for Distributions\nWhen testing for the goodness of fit for a distribution, observations in various non-overlapping ranges are classified into categories and a frequency count is obtained for each category or range. These (observed) frequency counts are compared to the counts which would be obtained if the hypothesised distribution fitted the data exactly. We call these counts the expected counts. In general one assumes that the parameters of the hypothesised distribution equal the estimates obtained from the data. Thus we are effectively just testing whether the shape of the hypothesised distribution is correct.\nFor example if a set of data has a sample mean of 10 and sample standard deviation of 2 and we wish to test whether a Normal distribution is appropriate for these data, we hypothesise a Normal distribution with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2. The following Chi-squared statistic can be used to test whether the hypothesised distribution describes the data reasonably well. The idea is to split the number line into, say, \\(c\\) non-overlapping intervals spanning the range of the data. The observed and expected frequency of data in each interval is then compared, using\n\\[\\chi ^{2} =\\sum _{1}^{c}\\frac{\\left({\\text   {Observed-Expected}}\\right)^2 }{{\\text   {Expected}}}  =\\sum _{1}^{c}\\frac{\\left( O-E\\right)^{2}}{E},\\]\nwhere again we sum over all \\(c\\) categories. For example, for \\(n=100\\) data we would expect 15.87% to be \\(\\leq 8\\), 34.13% to be greater than 8 and \\(\\leq 10\\) , 34.13% to be greater than 10 and \\(\\leq 12\\), and 15.87% to be \\(&gt;12\\). We would compare our observed counts with these expected ones. Note that expected counts need not be integers, and should not be rounded in the calculation of \\(\\chi^2\\), especially if they are small as that can introduce substantial round-off error into \\(\\chi^2\\).\nThe degrees of freedom for this test equals the number of data categories minus one more than the number of parameters estimated \\(c-1-2 = c-3\\) in this case). These tests were covered in your first-year paper. You should revise your notes on them. Note that we have seen in Chapter 4 that it is possible to test for normality using an tests such as Shapiro-Wilk test."

    "text": "Example: Porcine Stress Syndrome (PSS)\nPorcine Stress Syndrome (PSS) can result in the development of pale, soft meat in pigs and, under conditions of stress, sudden death. It can therefore result in severe economic loss. It is believed to be controlled by a single gene and its incidence could therefore be reduced by a selective breeding program. In a survey of its incidence, the following results were obtained for four major breeds. (The presence of PSS can be detected by a positive reaction to the breathing of halothane). The observed counts are shown in Table 4.\n\n\nCode\ndpss &lt;- tibble(\n  Breed = c(\"Large White\", \"Hampshire\", \"Landrace(B)\", \"Landrace(S)\"),\n  `Halothane positive` = c(2, 3, 11, 16),\n  `Halothane negative` = c(76, 86, 73, 76)\n) \n\nlibrary(janitor)\n\ndpss_with_totals &lt;- dpss |&gt; \n  adorn_totals(\n    name = c(\"Row total\", \"Column total\"),\n    where = c(\"row\", \"col\")\n    )\n\ndpss_with_totals\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Porcine Stress Syndrome (PSS) data\n\n\nBreed\nHalothane positive\nHalothane negative\nColumn total\n\n\n\n\nLarge White\n2\n76\n78\n\n\nHampshire\n3\n86\n89\n\n\nLandrace(B)\n11\n73\n84\n\n\nLandrace(S)\n16\n76\n92\n\n\nRow total\n32\n311\n343\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected values are calculated assuming independence between the rows and columns. This gives the numbers in parentheses in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Manual computation of ChSq statistic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example the expected value in the (3, 2) cell, the number of British Landrace pigs which gave a negative test for halothane, is \\[E_{3,2} = T_3 \\times T_2 /n = 84 \\times 311/343 = 76.2.\\] The Chi-squared statistic is calculated as before using the formula \\(\\chi^2 = \\sum(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2/E_{ij}\\). The Chi-square of 16.43 is associated with \\((4-1)\\times (2-1) = 3\\) degrees of freedom, and is therefore significant at the 5% level and at the 0.5% level. (Note that the tabulated value or critical value equals 7.81 at 5% significance level; and 12.8 at the 0.5% level).\nHence, there is strong statistical evidence that there are differences between breeds in the incidence of porcine stress syndrome. In other words, the breed is not independent of the result of the halothane test.\nNotice that the large counts in the second column (halothane negative) lead to large expected values but low contributions to the Chi-squared statistics (0.38, 0.35, 0.13 and 0.66). This is not surprising as each of these terms is divided by a large expected value. On the other hand, the small observations of the first column lead to small expected values but larger contributions to the Chi-squared statistic. Any Chi-squared contribution in excess of four (as explained previously) should be interpreted. In this example it is clear that Landrace (Swedish) pigs are more prone to porcine stress syndrome than are the other three breeds.\nAnother view of the idea of degrees of freedom can be obtained by noting that if the three expected values at the top of Column 2 are calculated (70.7, 80.7 and 76.2) then the remaining expected value can be found by subtraction from the appropriate row or column totals. Thus if the row and column totals are known, then only three numbers inside the contingency table are free before the whole table of numbers is then determined."

Without these contributions, the Chi-squared statistic would not be significant. The conclusion should then be that there is not enough evidence to conclude that the Chi-squared statistic is significant. So there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the cause of death depends on whether the injection was given.\nIf the Chi-square test involves many small expected counts, then we may obtain the \\(p\\)-value for the chi square statistic by Monte Carlo simulation (i.e. without relying on the Chi-square approximation). This simulation procedure involves random sampling from the set of all possible contingency tables having the same row and column totals.

The association seen in a particular table may disappear after amalgamation. Simpson (1951) provided the theory on why this happens for contingency tables data and hence this paradox is known as Simpson’s paradox even though this was observed by others before him. Consider the following R outputs showing the ChiSq test for two separate groups and then the amalgamated group.\nFor Group 1 counts, the Chi-square test is shown below:\n\n\nCode\ngroup1 &lt;- cbind(c(80,30), \n                c(120,80)) \ngroup1\n\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]   80  120\n[2,]   30   80\n\n\nCode\nchisq.test(group1)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction\n\ndata:  group1\nX-squared = 4.4809, df = 1, p-value = 0.03428\n\n\nFor group 2 counts, the Chi-square test is shown below:\n\n\nCode\ngroup2 &lt;- cbind(c(20,25),\n                c(75,20))\ngroup2\n\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]   20   75\n[2,]   25   20\n\n\nCode\nchisq.test(group2)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction\n\ndata:  group2\nX-squared = 15.122, df = 1, p-value = 0.0001008\n\n\nFor the amalgamated contingency table, we obtain-\n\n\nCode\nall &lt;- cbind(c(100,55),\n             c(195,100))\nall\n\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]  100  195\n[2,]   55  100\n\n\nCode\nchisq.test(all)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction\n\ndata:  all\nX-squared = 0.053808, df = 1, p-value = 0.8166\n\n\nEvidently the association seen in the subgroups is lost after amalgamation.\nThe opposite can also happen. That is, when populations are separated somewhat parallelly by a factor like Gender, the overall association may not filter to the same level of association for the two gender groups."

    "text": "Probability as a relative frequency\nThe naive or classical definition of probability is just a relative frequency. If \\(n\\) is the total number of equally likely possible outcomes and if \\(m\\) of those \\(n\\) outcomes result in the occurrence of some given event, then the probability of that event is \\(m/n\\).\nFor example, if a fair die is rolled, there are \\(n = 6\\) possible outcomes. Let the event of interest be getting a number 4 or more. So, the probability of this event is 3 out of 6 or \\(p=1/2\\).\nThe sample space or the set of all possible outcomes need not be finite. For example, tossing a coin until the first head appears will result in an infinite sample space.So, the probability can be viewed as a limiting or long run fraction of \\(m/n\\) (i.e. when \\(n \\to \\infty\\)).\nWhen the sample space is finite and outcomes are equally likely, we can assume that classical probability will be the same as empirical probability. Note that to find the probability of a fair coin landing heads it is not necessary to toss the coin repeatedly and observe the proportion of heads. So when the number of trails is reasonably large, empirical probability may be treated as the true value.\nSubjective probability (such as expert opinion) is useful in areas such as decision theory, and its definition does not fit as a relative frequency.\nProbabilities can only be between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) (impossible to certain)."

In other words, there is an inherent discontinuity in the values a discrete random variable can take.\nIf a random variable, \\(X\\), can take any value (i.e., not just integers) in some interval of the real line, it is called a continuous random variable. Examples include variables such as height, weight, length, percentage protein etc.\nFor a discrete random variable \\(X\\), the associated probabilities \\(P(X=x)\\) are also just points or masses, and hence the probability function \\(P(x)\\) is also called as the probability mass function (pmf).\nFor continuous random variables, probabilities can be computed when the variable falls in an interval such as \\(5\\) to \\(15\\), but not when it takes a fixed value such as \\(10\\) (which is equal to zero).\nThe probability density function (pdf) gives the probabilities as an area under the curve.\nFor example, consider a random proportion \\((X)\\) between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\). Here \\(X\\) follows a (standard) continuous uniform distribution whose (probability) density function \\(f(x)\\) is defined as follows:\n\\[f(x)=\\begin{cases}{1}~~~\\mathrm {for} \\ 0\\leq x\\leq 1,\\\\[9pt]0~~~\\mathrm {for} \\ x&lt;0\\ \\mathrm {or} \\ x&gt;1\\end{cases}\\]\nThis constant density function is very simple; see Figure 9.\n\n\nCode\ndata.frame(x = c(-.5, 1.5)) |&gt; \n  ggplot() + \n  aes(x) +\n  stat_function(\n    fun = dunif, \n    n = 10001, \n    args = list(min = 0, max = 1)\n    ) +\n  ylab(\"f(x)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Constant density between 0 and 1\n\n\n\n\nThe cumulative distribution function, CDF, \\(F(x)\\) gives the left tail area or probability up to \\(x\\).

Figure 17 is for a random sample of 200 from the standard normal distribution. Compare the departures from the expected theoretical shape. Recall that we covered the ECDF curves in the last Chapter.

Answer: Because:\n\nMany physical, biological, engineering and economic quantities do seem to follow a Normal distribution (sometimes after a transformation of the data to an appropriate scale). An example is that the logarithm of the ‘waiting time’ between earthquakes in Wellington is normally distributed. (The use of the logarithm may worry you, but it is natural for the subject area. Note that the magnitude of earthquakes is also measured on a logarithmic scale, namely the familiar Richter scale.)\nData that are approximately Normal seem to turn up very frequently in practice. In particular this may occur because\nThe Normal distribution is often what you get (for mathematical reasons) when you add together (or average) lots of different things. This result is known as the central limit theorem (CLT). For example, test scores are calculated by adding together marks from different questions, or share market movements are the result of many individuals and firms making private decisions. There is another theory which establishes that the sampling distributions of quantiles of continuous distributions of are approximately normal for large sample sizes.\nWe shall see in this course that residuals play a large part. These are, for example, the ‘errors’ left over after fitting a regression line to data. Quite often, we expect residuals to follow a Normal distribution.\n\n\n\nNormal data in practice\nIn practice, data from a ‘Normal distribution’ may not look very much like the ‘bell-curve’ unless there is very large amount of it. This statement has practical implications but first let us check whether the statement is true. We can do this by simulating batches of data from a Normal distribution (using software) and noting the variations across the data sets. Moreover, because the Normal distribution and its bell shaped curve are so important and ubiquitous, it is instructive to apply EDA methods to Normal data, for we would certainly like EDA methods to work well for that type of curve.\nFor the first batch, we simulated 1000 numbers from a Normal distribution with mean 80 and standard deviation of 12. The numbers could represent, for example, the diastolic blood pressure of 1000 adult New Zealanders. Figure 19 shows the histogram and the boxplot of the random normal data. Even though the typical bell-shaped pattern (theoretical normal curve shown in dotted lines) is evident, the histogram is not perfectly symmetric as the numbers were chosen at random so that by chance more fall into some classifications than would be expected. Also there are a few unusual values at the both extremes (see the boxplot). In practice if we didn’t know that the data came from a Normal distribution we might investigate the three highest points to see if they were valid points or outliers. The extreme edges of a data often comprise very atypical values we would not tend to place too much weight on the conflicting evidence they give about symmetry. The mean and median of this simulated batch are somewhat closer but the median is slightly off-centred from the quartiles.Well, so far so good. Now what if we have smaller batches?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Simulated normal data, n=100 and n=1000\n\n\n\n\nFor a normal distribution,\n68% of the values fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean\n95% of the values fall within 2 standard deviation of the mean\n99% of the values fall within 3 standard deviation of the mean.\n\nAs a special case, 50% of the values will fall within 0.6745 standard deviations of the mean. For symmetric distributions, mean equals the median.\n\n\nAssessment of Normality\nThe shapes of the ECDF curves shown in Figure 20 are typical of the empirical cumulative distributions for data from Normal populations. This curve was drawn using 1000 and 100 simulated random normal data. It could perhaps be described as an S-shape on its side (or lazy or stretched out S). The curve is flatter at either end which reflects the small amounts of relative frequency in the tails of the Normal distribution. The theoretical Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) curve for the normal distribution is also shown in Figure 20 as a smooth curve. For smaller samples from a Normal population, the ECDF curve will vary about the theoretical curve, and, of course, the variation is likely to be larger the smaller the sample; see Figure 20(B).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Simulated normal data, n=100 and n=1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal quantile-quantile plots\nTo visually check whether a given set of data are normally distributed, one can create a normal quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot. In this plot the quantiles of the sample are plotted against the theoretical quantiles of a standard normal distribution N(0,1). If the data, \\(Y_{i}\\), are normally distributed N(\\(\\mu, \\sigma\\)) then \\(Z_{i} = \\left(Y_{i} -\\mu \\right)/\\sigma\\) has a standard normal distribution. If we plot the quantiles of the data against corresponding quantiles of the standard normal distribution, the points should roughly lie on the straight line: \\[Y_{i} =\\mu +\\sigma Z_{i}\\] that is, a line with intercept \\(\\mu\\), and slope \\(\\sigma\\).\nWe should note that the mean and standard deviation do not appear in the formula \\(Y_{i} =\\mu +\\sigma Z_{i}\\) by coincidence. Rather, the mean and standard deviation are intimately connected to the normal distribution: if the data had not been normal then the line with these parameters would not pass through the data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Normal Quantile-Quantile Plot for Checking Normality\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21 shows the normal Q-Q plot for 50 random values from N(80,12). Note that the points in the middle largely plot on a line. It is natural that the tail part of the distribution shows more variation, and hence we will ignore such departures.\nThe normal Q-Q plot is presented as a normal probability plot in some software where the theoretical quantiles are replaced by the associated normal probabilities. Such normal probability plots show the sample data in the \\(X\\)-axis and the normal probabilities in the \\(Y\\)-axis. In both plots, we mainly look whether or not the points plot roughly on a straight line.\n\n\nCode\ndownload.file(\n  url = \"http://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/rangitikei.RData\",\n  destfile = \"rangitikei.RData\")\n\nload(\"rangitikei.RData\")\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(rangitikei) +\n  aes(sample = people) + \n  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line()\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(rangitikei) + aes(y=people, x=\"\") +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  xlab(\"\") + \n  coord_flip()\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=1) \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Normal Quantile-Quantile Plot for Checking Normality\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22 shows the normal Q-Q plot for the number of people who made use of a recreational facility (rangitikei). This plot clearly reveals that the data are not normal. The plotted points show a curved but asymmetric pattern. This pattern matches with the right skewness seen in the data (see the boxplot given in Figure 22.\nNote that normality and symmetry are not the same. If the true distribution of the data is symmetric such as uniform, rectangular or triangular distributions, then the normal Q-Q plot will show a symmetric pattern for the plotted points but they will not plot on a straight line. As an example, the normal Q-Q plots for batches of random data from Student’s \\(t\\) (to be covered later in the next Chapter) and few other symmetric distributions is shown in Figure 23. Clearly normality is rejected for other symmetric non-normal distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Normal Quantile-Quantile Plot for Checking Normality"

    "section": "Categorical or Qualitative Data",
    "text": "Categorical or Qualitative Data\n\nNominal Data\nAt this level, objects are classified by qualities or characteristics, and are placed in categories. Often these categories are really only names, for example Ford Focus, Mondeo, or Mustang; Boeing 737, 747 or 767, etc. Hence we describe the data as ‘nominal’. Sometimes confusion arises because the names are replaced (coded) by numbers as in the aeroplane example, or to facilitate data entry into a computer. An example of the latter would be a person’s marital status, coded as 1 (never married), 2 (currently married), 3 (widowed) or 4 (separated or divorced). It would make no sense to perform any mathematical manipulation on these numbers for they are only abbreviations for the categories. Notice that categories should cover all possibilities so that a further category may be needed, namely 5 (in a de facto relationship).\n\n\nOrdinal Data\nOrdinal data are categorical but the levels have an intrinsic order to them. Typical examples are a 3-point scale for burns - mild, moderate, severe, or a 5-point agreement scale - strongly disagree; disagree; no opinion; agree; strongly agree.\nThe distances between any two responses may differ. For example, disagree may be perceived by some respondents, although not others, as closer to strongly disagree than to no opinion. For this reason, there are problems in aggregating such responses. There are ‘nonparametric’ statistical methods to cope with these problems. It may be feasible, however, to add or average responses if the sample size is reasonably large and the assumption can be made that the differences in usage of the measures will average out over the sample."

    "section": "Quantitative (i.e., measured or counted) data",
    "text": "Quantitative (i.e., measured or counted) data\n\nDiscrete Data\nDiscrete data usually arises by counting events or objects. Because of this discrete data are usually integers, but not always. For example, one may count the number of accidents last year at a particular intersection. On the one hand you can’t have fractions since you can’t have half an accident. On the other hand a further analysis may require you to state the proportion of the accidents that were nose-to-tail. Then if there were n accidents, the proportion of nose-to-tail ones could be \\(\\frac{0}{n}, \\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{2}{n}, ... ,\\frac{n}{n}\\) - a finite range of values, so the proportion is still discrete.\n\n\nContinuous Data\nWithout going into the mathematical definition of continuity, we tend to visualise continuous data as having a flowing nature, like water flowing under a bridge, or time passing in a continuous fashion. So one could in theory measure amounts (of water or time) to any level of precision, with many decimal places. Of course in practice, the measured responses will rarely be exactly continuous for, even if the underlying variables are assumed continuous, the instrument used to take readings will only be able to do so on a discrete scale. If the variable of interest is time, responses may be integers (say) 1, 2, … seconds or if the instrument can distinguish to the nearest \\(\\frac{1}{100}\\) of a second, the response will still be discrete but is now 1.00, 1.01 or 0.99. What we can say is that if the unit of measurement is sufficiently small then each individual possible reading will have an infinitesimal probability of occurring and we can basically ignore such individual points and only talk about probability in terms of intervals (e.g. one-second intervals rather than individual 10.99 seconds, say). Thus the practical difference between discrete and continuous data is that with real discrete data, outcomes each have their own separate probability of occurring, but with continuous data, probability is only thought of as associated with intervals.\n\n\nInterval and ratio scales\nStatisticians sometimes further distinguish among quantitative variables as being interval or ratio data. In fact some theoreticians write at length about the ‘four levels of measurement’: nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio.\nFor interval scale responses are assumed to be points on a linear scale. For example on a temperature scale the difference between 10 and 20 degrees is the same as between 30 and 40 degrees. On the usual Fahrenheit or Celsius scale there is a problem with respect to the origin, or zero point, as 20 degrees cannot be assumed to be twice as hot as 10 degrees. It would be meaningful to take differences between measurements or add them together but not to divide or multiply them. In many statistical formulae, deviations from means are involved which obviates the need for an absolute zero, and ratios such as slopes are quite acceptable.\nRatio scales are sometimes regarded the highest level of measurement, and are usually referred to by saying there is a fixed (or absolute) zero. An example would be the number of people in a room (can’t have negatives!) or the time taken to complete a given task. In this case, a reading of 4.2 seconds is twice that of 2.1 seconds. That is, it is meaningful to perform all the mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\nFrom a practical point of view, the type of data (categorical - nominal or ordinal; discrete; or continuous) may be crucial to the statistical analysis. It may be convenient to use a statistical method appropriate to ratio level data in the case mentioned above of the time to complete a given task, but the results may also be analysed by a non-parametric technique which actually only requires ordinal data. Similarly it may be satisfactory as a first step to analyse ordinal data by assigning scores {1, 2, 3, 4, and 5} to the categories and running the data through a regression package that assumes Normal data (better approaches are available!). Indeed, it may be difficult in some circumstances to clearly decide on the appropriate level, and the distinction particularly between interval and ratio levels is often unimportant."

    "section": "Measuring Devices or Instruments",
    "text": "Measuring Devices or Instruments\nAny device used to collect measurements is called an instrument. It may be a physical device such as a measuring rule to gauge the heights of plants or a counting device such as a Geiger-counter for measuring radioactive material. In the social sciences or marketing, the instrument may be such a physical device or it may be a questionnaire which requires a more subjective response.\n\nMeasurement Error\nMeasurement error may arise if the instrument tends to give a reading which is too high or too low. Instruments should be checked as often as possible and standardised by checking them against known standards. This is not really possible with questionnaires but one should note the need for pilot testing the questionnaire on a group of subjects who are not in the frame for the survey.\n\n\nIndirect Measures\nIt is a common mistake to assume that the values reported for a variable are direct measurements of that variable. It is more usually the case that the recorded value reflects the desired value but is only an indirect measure of it. A doctor may wish to have some measure of the health of a patient, and, for this reason, a blood pressure measurement is taken, but blood pressure is not a direct measure of health for there are many inherited, climatic and individual effects which also play a part in the blood pressure reading. Even then a typical blood pressure reading would be required, but the mere fact that a measurement is being made will have an effect on the patient and possibly affect the reading. The stress of being in a hospital or a doctor’s surgery may increase the measurement.\nIt should be noted that the instrument used will only rarely be able to give a direct reading. Temperature is often gauged by the expansion of mercury in glass tube which is an indirect measure and will depend on a number of factors and assumptions, perhaps the greatest being that the expansion of the mercury is linear with temperature. In most experiments the measurements, even if indirect, are closely correlated with the variable under study but such assumptions should not be accepted too readily.\nAnother question which should be asked of data is who did the recording? Often, questionnaires require that people provide the information themselves, that is by self-reporting. Conscious or sub-conscious influences may have some bearing on the numbers provided. If someone is asked his/her income or workload, the answer may depend on what is perceived by the respondent as the aim of the survey, who is asking the question and who will have access to the results. A seemingly direct question may evoke an indirect answer. If the data is collected by a researcher or technician there may be some possible hiccups on the interface between the respondent and the researcher or the instrument and researcher."

    "section": "Range of Instruments",
    "text": "Range of Instruments\nThe range of instruments is immense and in the remainder of this section a few examples will be given.\n\nObservation\nIt is common in the study of animals or birds to observe them in their natural settings. This may be done directly such as counting the number of wingbeats per minute or it may be of an indirect approach such as counting the frequency of spore in order to determine the number of animals in a given area. This method of data gathering is often costly and time-consuming. It may help to answer what is occurring rather than why.\nAs there is a high labour content with this instrument, errors may occur due to tiredness and boredom and coding errors may be a problem depending on how well defined are the categories to be observed. If many observers are involved, there is the added difficulty that the same behaviour may be perceived differently and hence coded differently by different observers.\nObservation does have an important part to play in a preliminary study to decide on the areas which require further study. Some researchers tend to bypass or shorten this phase by using a multivariate package on the computer hoping that it will sort out important relationships from a morass of complex data. It is surprising how many novel and correct scientific processes were discovered by such painstaking workers as Darwin and Mendel using only visual observation.\n\n\nInterviews\nThis method can suffer from some of the problems of observation in that it can be time consuming, involve coding errors and be influenced by different interviewers making different judgements.\nInterviewers need to be carefully trained so that they allow the person being interviewed to express his or her own views rather than interposing their own feelings or prejudices. On the positive side, a trained interviewer can sense nuances behind supplied answers in a way that observations or questionnaires cannot. A much richer range of responses can then be recorded which makes the interview ideal for pilot studies in particular as it can open up new avenues of study.\n\n\nQuestionnaires\nQuestionnaires are a common method used to collect data and they are very versatile as they can be administered by mail, telephone or face to face. Mailed questionnaires have the advantage of being efficient time-wise for a researcher and may be less threatening to the respondent as they can be answered when and where the respondent chooses. They are appropriate if the respondent needs to give some thought to the questions or where the answers involve sensitive information. Unfortunately, this flexibility can lead to respondents procrastinating or not replying at all. The problem of non-response will be considered later.\nHow long should the questionnaire be? Almost invariably, it is too long as the researcher strives to obtain as much information as possible. A long and tiresome questionnaire may be counter-productive as the quality of the data may suffer. There has been a lot of research on questionnaire design. Some points to note are that straightforward questions should be asked near the beginning so that the respondent feels at ease while questions requiring judgements or moral decisions should come later."

    "text": "The Human Interface\nMention has been made of some problems associated with respondents giving replies and researchers seeking to understand those replies and to code them. It is worthwhile taking more time to reconsider these processes for the quality of data will invariably be greatly affected by the human interface with the research instrument.\nThe yields of different varieties of field grasses would seem to be a clear cut and well defined and measured quantity but the yield would be influenced by many factors such as the height of the cut, perhaps the speed at which the mower is operated and the ability of the assistant to mow within the specified boundaries.\nWith more subjective instruments and human respondents other problems may arise and affect the quality of the data.\n\nHuman Respondents\nA number of possible difficulties may arise:\n\nA question, which is clear-cut and unambiguous to the researcher, may not be so to the respondent who may not understand the question or is not too sure about it because it is framed in unfamiliar language or relates to something outside his or her experience.\nThe response may depend on a number of extraneous factors such as how cheerful and at ease the respondent feels.\nQuestions may require remembering certain facts or feelings and memory can be very selective.\nThe situation may involve many variables while the respondent is asked to respond on only one dimension, which may be perceived as a composite of these other variables. The respondent may not be able to make the judgements necessary to give an accurate response. In one questionnaire, some questions may be answered very accurately while others may be of doubtful value. If responses are added in some way to give a total, there may be a problem in that some of the components have been measured accurately but others are less precise.\nQuestionnaires can be self-fulfilling prophecies in that the structure and language of the questions suggest the correct or desired responses. Socialising factors may prejudice the results in that most people are hesitant to be rude or to reveal to strangers their deep desires and true feelings, particularly if these are thought to be socially undesirable.\n\n\n\nResearchers\nThe human interface also arises when someone administers the instrument of the research and some points to note are:\n\nThe competence of the researchers and assistants is important. Judgement may be required to understand the response and to make a note of it. In an interview situation, the researcher must listen and try to understand the responses in terms of his or her framework of judgements and in relation to the aim of the interview. With more objective instruments, they must be read accurately but even with such measuring scales one assistant may tend to read high or to record even calibrations whereas another would not do so, which introduces an unwanted variation in the data collection process.\nThe feelings and beliefs of the assistant may intrude into the collection process. The interaction with the subject in this way may introduce other unwanted variation.\nIt is a salutary point to note that usually the individual who collects the raw data is an underpaid and possibly under-trained junior who is not highly motivated to produce high quality data.\n\n\n\nSelf-Administered Tests\nIn some situations, the subject records the response as in self-administered questionnaires, for example, tick a box or circle a number. There may be advantages in this for the respondent is presumably the best person to know what response should be given. On the other hand, the respondent is usually not trained so that there may be a higher incidence of coding errors and questions which are left unanswered. On the other hand, if the researcher does the coding, unwarranted assumptions may be made.\nIt is conceivable that many human interventions and possible errors may occur in an experiment. For example, a field worker may make certain observations which are studied by another assistant who decides on categories for them while a further assistant codes these categories and finally another person enters them into a computer. Errors are possible at each step along the way.\nAt the other extreme, it is possible for information to be relayed directly to the computer without human interference. Microprocessors can be used to collect and transmit a whole variety of information. In experiments on animals, sensors can be placed on different parts of their bodies to relay information to the computer. These facilities open up new vistas and challenges for statisticians to monitor large amounts of data, for it may not be obvious how to cope with them."

    "section": "Non-response Bias",
    "text": "Non-response Bias\nNon response is very common in all types of data collection and is probably the largest source of non-sampling error. It can occur at three stages of the process. An element may be selected but not found. For example, sheep in a flock may be tagged with individual identification number but one may not be found at the time of the survey. It may be hiding or perhaps has died. If the elements are people, some may not be at home at the time, or, if it is a telephone survey, the telephone may be cut off from certain selected individuals.\nIt may not be possible to take a measurement. This happens quite often with people as some may forget, or refuse, to answer the questionnaire. The measuring instrument may not work or give a ludicrous response which may be deleted by the technician. An element may be contacted, a measurement taken but the result not written down in the correct place, or could be so illegible that it cannot be used.\nWherever possible, nonresponse bias should be reduced by making every possible effort to obtain a response. When interviewing people about a particular product, market researchers will often make two call backs (that is three attempts in all) to reach a subject if that person is not at home on the first call. Cost factors will often prohibit further attempts. Surveys by mail often include a stamped addressed envelope or even money or a token for merchandise to arouse moral scruples and force a reply.\nThe problems arising from nonresponse can be illustrated with a simple example: Suppose that 200 people are asked their opinion on a certain issue, only 100 reply of whom 70 are in favour, 30 opposed.\nWhat percentage of the original 200 are in favour?\nThe answer depends on the assumptions made.\n\nSuppose the nonrespondents feel the same about the issue as the respondents.

Then the estimate of the number in favour is 170/200 or 85%.\nIt may be possible to make other reasonable assumptions if additional information is at hand on the whole batch of 200. We can massage the results in different ways but none of them is very convincing. The moral is: Try to reduce nonresponse by all legitimate means."

    "text": "Some Terminology\nIn a census, every element of the population is contacted, counted and other quantities collected or evaluated. Conceptually, the procedure is straightforward and perhaps trivial. In practice and particularly if the population is large, difficulties often arise. There are three critical operations in census taking, namely identifying an element as belonging to the population under study, making contact with that element and obtaining the appropriate information in a suitable form.\nIt may be helpful, at this point, to introduce some terminology to formalise the process of taking a census. The population at which the study is aimed is termed the target population . To obtain information from this population it is necessary to have a means of operationalising the data collection. This involves a frame, which may be a listing of the elements of the population or it may be an operating method such as a geographical map, suitably divided into smaller, manageable areas. A further step is necessary to contact each element of the frame and collect the appropriate information. The resulting set of elements on which completed, usable data has been collected could be called the actual population. It is possible to consider these populations as consisting of the measurements under study rather than the elements, be they objects, animals or people. More will be said on this later.\nCensus taking can then be represented by the sequence\ntarget population \\(\\Rightarrow\\) frame \\(\\Rightarrow\\) actual population.\nIdeally, these three populations would consist of the same elements but in practice they could be represented in Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Relationship between the target population, frame and actual population\n\n\nA simple example of a census would be the exercise of collecting information from the students in a particular school. Suppose the school authorities want to discover, from each student, the number of younger siblings who may wish to attend the school in future years. At first glance, the target population is well defined, as the current students in the school. However queries could arise such as whether adult or part-time pupils should be included. The most suitable frame would, no doubt, be the school roll. Hopefully, the roll would accurately reflect the students currently at the school but it may not exactly match the target population. Some students may be temporarily visiting the school, either staying with relatives or a parent who has a local, temporary job. On the other hand, some students on the roll may be visiting another part of the country, or may be in a hospital or other institution, and there may be some doubt whether their absence is temporary or permanent.\nFrame inefficiencies may well occur to the extent that the frame does not match the target population. The collection of information on siblings may encounter snags as some students may not respond due to absence, or parents or student may refuse to divulge the required information. The actual population may then fall short of the frame, which contains the maximum possible elements, which in this case, are students."

    "text": "Elements, Measures and Associated Variables\nWith a census, there is usually some ambivalence as to whether the objects under study are the elements of the population (such as plants, animals or people) or the measurements on these elements. The measurements may simply be the count, or may be such variables as the length, weight, salary or any other measure. The selection process will focus mainly on the elements, but from then on attention will be focussed on measurement and then analysis. These two ideas can be incorporated into the notation \\[U=\\left(L,Y,X\\right)\\] Here \\(U\\) denotes the population, \\(L\\) is the set of labels \\((i = 1,2,...,N)\\) attached to the \\(N\\) elements of the population, \\(Y\\) is the measurement, or response, under study from each element in the population, and \\(X\\) is an associated variable measured on each element in the population.\nFor example, for the census carried out on the students of a high school, the labels \\(i\\) could be the identification numbers of the students on the roll \\(L\\). The measurement on the \\(i^{th}\\) student, represented by \\(y_i\\), may be a variable such as the daily expenditure at the school tuck shop. The associated variable, \\(x_i\\), for the \\(i^{th}\\) student may be the student’s weight. On the other hand, the mark a student gets on a standardised test when entering high school may be \\(x_i\\), with \\(y_i\\) the school certificate mark of that student in mathematics.\nIn this example the survey may, in practice, be carried out as a sample rather than a census but conceptually it would be possible, to carry out such a census. Another point which may need discussion and clarification is whether the population represented by \\(U\\) should refer to the target population, the frame or the actual population; usually \\(U\\) would refer to the target population."

As no sampling procedure is involved, it seems reasonable to label errors as non-sampling errors.\nThe goal of the survey will be to produce summary statistics such as the population mean and standard deviation. If errors are committed in the collection process, the summary statistics may be incorrect. It is possible that these errors will cancel out but we cannot rely on this. The errors may lead to a tendency for the calculated mean to be too low and the mean is said to be biased.

    "text": "Introduction\nSampling as a scientific exercise is a peculiarly twentieth century phenomenon despite the fact that sampling has been used in an ad hoc manner from earliest times. Sampling, as in sample surveys, was accepted only after many years of argument and counter-argument. The most intensive and extensive discussion took place at the International Statistical Institute (ISI) meeting in Berne in 1895. Kiaer explained the ‘representative method’ he had used in Norway. Further meetings of the ISI enabled Kiaer to expand and clarify his approach. Four principles have been identified in Kiaer’s reasoning:\n\nRepresentativeness in terms of adequate representation of identifiable groups in the population.\nSelection of objects to be as objective as possible.\nThe reliability of the results should be assessed. Each survey should be divided into a number of distinct parts using a different representative method for each. Comparison of results of these parts would provide evidence as to how much faith could be placed in the results of the survey.\nFinally, Kiaer insisted on a complete specification of the method of selection.\n\nBowley (1906) provided a theory of inference for survey samples which helped to answer the question of how accurate an estimate from a large sample was. Using a Bayesian argument, his approach was only valid for the case where the chances were the same for all items of the groups to be sampled.\nIt was not until Neyman (1934) that random, rather than purposeful, sampling was given a strong mathematical justification. Neyman showed that it did not matter if equal or unequal probabilities were used provided that probabilities were known in advance. His arguments were not based on specific distributions as in Bayesian approaches so that the touchstone of randomness seemed to have finally won the day. For an interesting discussion on the controversies in the history of survey sampling, see Brewer (2013)."

    "section": "Why Sample?",
    "text": "Why Sample?\nThere is a widespread belief that a census, rather than a sample, should be taken if at all possible. Most people feel secure with a census but are somewhat uneasy about only collecting a sample and using mathematical means to estimate properties of the population. Lack of sufficient resources of money, trained manpower and so on is often the motivation to reject a complete enumeration. A compromise, of course, is necessary in that a cheaper, quicker collection method using a sample may result in less accurate estimates. Often, however, the reduction in accuracy is slight compared with the considerable reduction in cost. Time is also a factor in that a census may require officials to collect data over a long period which may raise difficulties in that the responses would be meant to relate to a particular point in time.\nAn important point which is often overlooked is that a complete enumeration is only superior to a sample if the data is collected and processed at the same high standard. Often, researchers try to collect too much data for the resources and trained man-power available which results in a large amount of data whose accuracy and validity is suspect. A well collected sample will always be of more use than a shoddily taken census. Another common fault is the attempt to collect too much information from every element, be it an object, animal or person. A questionnaire has a tendency to expand to the point that it frustrates or annoys the recipient or the personnel administering it. In countries where monthly household surveys are held, their results are invariably more accurate than the less frequent population censuses.\nOne classical case in which a sample is preferable to a census is that of destructive sampling in which each object is tested until it breaks or expires. For example, testing the number of hours a light bulb shines before it burns out. The selected items are useless after the test so that there are compelling reasons for limiting the size of the sample. It is salutary to realise that many people selected to give information or to take part in tests or experiments will be affected in some ways. The process of collecting data will itself affect the elements in the sample so that they may no longer be representative of the population about which inferences are to be made. For example, in some quarters, there is a fear that political opinion polls do not merely reflect public opinion but to some extent form it.\nNonsampling errors, nonresponse in particular may introduce biases. Unfortunately, the size and/or direction of these biases are generally unknown. Due to the smaller size of a sample, it may be much easier to reduce nonresponse than in a much more cumbersome enumeration. Call-backs and other procedures which have been devised to reduce nonresponse are very time consuming so that they are rarely feasible when the number of elements is large.\nTo reduce unwanted effects such as interviewer biases, statistical tests can be employed. These require certain assumptions about the population and selection method which have been used. We can never be sure that the assumptions associated with these tests are valid. If the sample suggests that they may not be true, some action must be taken such as a data transformation to make the results more ‘Normal’."

    "text": "The Case for Randomisation\n\n“Randomization is too important to be left to chance.”\n– J. D. Petruccelli\n\nThe sample should be similar to the population. It is easier to state this than it is to define what is meant by the statement and how to achieve this similarity. Randomisation can be used to obtain a sample which, on average, has similar properties to the population. Not only is this so but it is possible to estimate how closely the sample reflects the population and attach a probability to the possible discrepancy. It is not possible to state with certainty that a particular measurement from a sample is peculiar although it would be possible to attach a probability to such an unusual value. Similarly, it would be possible to make a probability statement about the sample itself if the sampling process was replicated.\nIf the distribution of the variables is known, randomisation enables the distributions of some combinations of the sample values to be calculated. In common with other areas of statistics, it is more likely that the distributions of these variables are not known although these distributions may be hypothesised. The validity of any conclusions will be subject to the proviso that the assumptions are correct. If the distributions are not known the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) may be invoked so that the approximate Normal distributions may be assumed for some estimators.\nOn the other hand, there are enticing reasons for placing restrictions on the sample to make it similar to the population in many respects such as proportions in certain subgroups. Surveys are rarely carried out as a theoretical exercise and results may only be believed if those who commissioned and financed the survey believe in its accuracy. If the sample appears peculiar in relation to some known variables, the validity of the survey may be called in question. To obtain a representative sample to fit the known, or assumed, distribution in the population, the elements may be selected purposely. The resulting estimators of variables may be very accurate but there is no way of determining how accurate they are.\nAs a compromise, it is possible to use a randomisation scheme with certain restrictions. A simple example is that of stratified sampling with different probabilities of selection for each stratum. This procedure can be extended to allow each element in the population to have its own probability of inclusion into the sample. Alternatively, a randomisation approach can be used to draw a sample which may be rejected, however, if certain restrictions are not fulfilled. An important point is that the sample should be chosen with a known probability. Another point to note is that the known information about a population will involve a variable, for example \\(X\\), whereas the measurements to be collected are from a another variable, say \\(Y\\). The efficacy of the survey will depend heavily on the accuracy of \\(X\\) and the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nIt should be noted that restrictions may limit the number of elements selected from particular subgroups so that it may not be reasonable to invoke the Central Limit Theorem and assume that estimators in these subgroups follow a Normal distribution."

    "text": "Terminology and Notation for Samples\nA sample is a subset of a population. There are innumerable ways of drawing a sample so that there is a richness and variety in sampling methods which do not exist in census methods. The first step in obtaining a sample is the same as for taking a census in that a frame must be set up. The sample is then drawn from the frame so that the sequence is target population \\(\\Rightarrow\\) frame \\(\\Rightarrow\\) sample.\nThe relationship between population and sample is shown in Figure 2 (which is almost the same as Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Relationship between the target population, frame and sample\n\n\nIt was pointed out above that a population, in practice the frame, could be written as \\(U=\\left(L,Y,X\\right)\\). By contrast probability samples could be denoted by \\(S = \\{P_r, l, y, x\\}\\). The curly brackets, {.} are meant to indicate that there are many samples which can be drawn from the one population. Note that \\(S\\) is the set of all possible samples, \\(s\\), selected under the probability scheme \\(P_r\\). The labels in the sample as well as the sample values for \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) are denoted by lower case letters. In general, the convention is to use capitals when referring to the population but lower case for the sample. The term \\(P_r\\) indicates the probability, \\(P_r(s)\\), of the sample \\(s\\) being selected.\nAnother way to look at this is to consider the probability that a particular element, or label, be included in the sample. Let \\(\\pi_{i}\\) be the inclusion probability for the \\(i^{th}\\) label. A special but common occurrence is the equality of the \\(\\pi_{i}\\) for \\(i\\) from \\(1\\) through \\(N\\) and, in this case, the \\(P_r(s)\\) will be the same for all \\(s\\) in \\(S\\). In this case, the selection is said to be EPSEM, standing for equal probability of selection, or it is said that the elements are self weighing as the probabilities do not depend on the particular labels which have already been selected. The most obvious example of a self weighting sample is that of a simple random sample but multistage samples can also be arranged with unequal probabilities at each stage but such that the inclusion probabilities are equal."

    "section": "Errors in Samples",
    "text": "Errors in Samples\nSamples will be liable to the same kind of biases as a census as well as others inherent in the sampling process. Major sources of biases in samples are classified in Figure 3. On the one hand, the biases can be split into those which occur at the time of selecting the sample, while others occur at the stage of collecting and operation on the data. On the other hand, a division can be made into sampling and nonsampling, depending on whether the bias occurs in a random or fixed manner. The nonsampling errors can be further subdivided according to whether an observation is made or not.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Classification of Sources of Survey Biases\n\n\nBriefly, the cells in Figure 3 refer to the following problems:\n\nFrame inefficiencies: To select a sample, a frame, which is often a listing but may be such as a map, is used. If certain items are missing or occur more than once, these items and the others in the frame will have a probability of selection which is different from what it should be.\nBiased estimation: In this course, only unbiased estimates such as the sample mean are considered.\nNon-observation: Non-observation could be due to frame inefficiencies or not being able to locate the item.\nNon-response: The item, say a particular person, may be located but he or she may be not at home or refuse to answer all or some of the questions.\nPurposive Selection: When selection occurs deliberately rather than at random then biases will often intrude. In quota sampling, the interviewer is told to contact so many people over 45, or male, or in some other category. The personal choice involved in this selection could introduce bias.\nInterviewer bias, coding errors: Certain characteristics of the interviewer may incline the subject to respond in a certain way. With another interviewer, the subject may respond differently. Once the data is collected, errors can occur in an amazing number of ways in coding the answer, transcribing to summary sheets, entering the data into a computer, as well as error in computer programming.\n\nOther errors are termed random or stochastic in that probabilities are involved so that samples, but not censuses, may suffer from these errors. The assumption is made that the measurement is correct but the estimator varies depending on the sample which has been drawn. Rather than giving the name error to this outcome it would be preferable to speak of sampling variation.\nOur aim in sampling and in all statistical estimation, is to find an estimate which is close to the population parameter. Of course, we have a problem in defining “close” as we do not know if our sample is representative of the whole population or whether it is an unusual one. If the sample yields an estimate of the population parameter we can at least talk about the expected or average distance of the estimate from the parameter.\nAn illustration of the ideas of bias and variance is that of shots fired at a target. If the shots are widely scattered, they exhibit a large variance. If they are spread around the target so that on average they are equally scattered around the bulls-eye (neither too high nor too low etc.), we could say they are unbiased shots of the bulls-eye. The four possible cases are shown in Figure 4).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Bias and variance\n\n\nNotice that bias can occur in census as well as sample data, but we can only talk about variance in a probability sample. From a single sample yielding one value of a statistic, it is not possible to estimate the bias in the statistic but an estimate of the variance of the statistic can be obtained from the variation in the sample.\nEach sample is not an exact match of the population so that the resulting estimator will invariably differ from the population parameter it is estimating. As the parameter is unknown, the actual difference between the estimator and the parameter is also unknown so that it is important to have certain assumptions about the distributor of the variable under study and distribution of the resulting estimator. Mathematical theory is often available to indicate the amount of bias and variance in the estimator.\nUsually, a sampling method is chosen to ensure that the resulting estimator is unbiased. A peculiar sample does not necessarily mean that the estimator is biased but it may be difficult to convince others that this is so. For example, it may turn out that the sample consists only of females even though the population is evenly divided between the sexes. If females and males give similar responses to the variable under question, the strange composition of the sample in this case would not affect the value obtained for the estimator. On the other hand, a sample which seems to be representative of the population on certain variables may yield a strange value for the estimator. One must assume, for there is no proof as the parameters under study are unknown, that if the sample is chosen carefully, which usually means that an appropriate randomisation scheme is employed, the measurements and hence the estimate obtained will be representative of the population.\nOften, the sample and the estimator are chosen in such a way that the estimator is unbiased. The sampling scheme and the estimator can be considered as two sides of the same coin so that the estimator is chosen to fit the sampling scheme. Furthermore, the sampling scheme can be chosen in such a way that the variance of the estimator is a minimum subject to certain constraints such as cost and time. At times an estimator is chosen deliberately to be biased if in so doing the variance is made smaller. To compensate for this for it may be that a biased estimator will ensure that it is closer to the parameter of interest than an unbiased estimator. These considerations are of more interest to the analysis of data than to their collection; so this topic will not be considered at length here.\nIn sample surveys, an estimator may turn out to be biased because the probability of selection of certain elements is different to what the researcher thought. If the frame used to select people is a list of homeowners, wealthy owners would have a higher probability of selection for they are more likely than less well off people to own more than one house. Consequently, an owner of multiple houses would have a high probability of selection which would bias the estimate towards such people unless the multiple ownership is taken into account. This source of error is termed frame inefficiency and it is likely to arise whenever there are discrepancies with the sampling frame."

It is common in experimental design when treatments are allocated to experimental units. In quality control, simple random sampling is often used.\nIf the population is large, at least in relation to the sample size, it would usually be inefficient to use simple random sampling for it would require considerable time and cost to select and contact the elements of such a sample. If the sampling fraction is large, (say) more than ten percent, it may be reasonable to use simple random sampling as it is likely that the sample will be spread reasonably evenly throughout the population.\nThe more additional information available, the more structured the sampling design can be. The additional information may be of an exact dichotomous or polychotomous nature such as the natural division of the frame into three disparate geographical areas. The additional variable may be continuous such as the age structure of the frame. In other cases, the information may be assumed rather than known for certain. For example, the educational level achieved by every person in a frame may be listed but this information may be a few years out of date. In these cases, a sample survey may be taken based on the age structure of the frame, but the conclusions will only be valid to the extent that there has been no change in this age structure.\nThe additional information can be the basis for the logistics of the survey as different parts of the frame may require more intensive sampling or different methods of organisation. For example, if the frame covers rural and urban areas, the urban sectors may be reached by public transport, but respondents may not be at home during the day as they are likely to be at work. The rural areas may involve other difficulties due to the scattered nature of the population.\nThe obvious danger is that sampling decisions made for administrative ease may hinder accumulation of data and may discredit inferences drawn from the resulting sample. For example, one must query whether the responses collected by one interviewer are likely to be considerably different from those of another, whether data collected by face-to-face methods can be aggregated with data collected by telephone interviews; whether data collected on some elements can be assumed to be similar to other data collected at a later time; whether responses to questions which must be translated into different languages, or explained in simpler English to someone of limited education or facility in English, can give responses which can be aggregated with responses to these same questions when not translated. There are no easy answers to questions such as these but researchers should be aware of such difficulties. Whenever possible, the peculiarities in the collection method should be noted and made available to the reader so that he/she can better judge the conclusions of the survey.\nEstimators with a low variance are likely to be more accurate in that they reflect population values more closely. The use of additional information can lead to a reduction in the variance of estimators such as sample means and sample proportions. This gain in efficiency will depend on the strength of the relationship between the additional information and the variable under study. At times, this relationship may be estimated but, at other times, it must be taken for granted.\nIf the population is small but there is no information available on other aspects of the population, a simple random sample may be appropriate. Other sampling schemes may be used, though, for some of the following reasons:\n\nAdministrative problems\nIf the population size is large, it will be rather clumsy to try to select a simple random sample. If the population is spread out geographically, then considerable cost may be involved unless the sample is grouped in some way.\n\n\nImprove accuracy\nUnder certain conditions, or assumptions, it may be possible to use a scheme which leads to more accurate estimates - accurate in the sense that the variance and/or bias is reduced.\n\n\nPolitical reasons\nA simple random sample of (say) supermarkets in New Zealand may, by chance, consist only of stores in Auckland. The results of this survey may be viewed very sceptically by readers and, more importantly, by those who are funding the survey."

With stratified sampling, the population is divided into groups called “strata”, and then random samples are taken from each stratum. The advantages of this approach are:\n\nIt is a flexible approach, as strata can be designated in different ways.\nEach stratum can be treated as a separate population so that strata could be surveyed at different times and even different ways. For example, a survey in NZ could be divided into north and south island, urban and rural; the rural sample could be contacted by telephone but the urban by face-to-face interviews. One stratum could involve systematic sampling; other involve simple random sampling.\nIf we have information regarding the variation in strata then the resulting estimator (of the population mean for instance) could be more precise (less variance) than in simple random sampling if the more variable strata are sampled more intensely.\nIt is probably the most common method employed in sample surveys.\nThe sample is spread throughout the population.\nThe variance of an estimate from stratified sampling is usually equal to, or less than, the variance of an estimate from simple random sampling. It would be sensible to sample more heavily the larger strata. This is the approach taken in proportional (stratified) sampling in which the sample size in each stratum is proportional to the size of the stratum. Proportional sampling is appropriate when all the strata are equally variable. When this is not the case the more variable strata are sampled more heavily."

Cluster and stratified sampling differ in that all the strata are sampled whereas only some of the clusters are sampled. It is usual to have a large number of small clusters in cluster sampling but a small number of strata in stratified sampling. Consider a sample survey of the pupils in a school. The classes within the school may be considered as possible strata or possible clusters. There are advantages for cluster sampling in this case.\n\nEase of administration. It will be easier to select certain classes in a school (say) and interview a random sample or all of the students in those classes rather than selecting students from all the classes in the school.\nA listing of all the children is only necessary for the selected classes.\nConfidentiality and/or independence of response may be aided by this approach. It would take longer to collect information from all the classes in the school and the longer it takes the more likely it is that respondents will talk among themselves about the questions before the researcher can collect his/her information. If the whole class is presented with the questionnaire at the same time, confidentiality is more likely to be preserved.\nLocating elements (students) is easier, travel (between classrooms) will be reduced, and it is easy to divide responsibility between interviewers.\n\nIn some cases, it makes more sense to collect measurements on whole clusters rather than just a few individuals within each selected cluster. This is probably true in the case of the above example. Surveys on TV watching collect information on a family is another example where this is probably true. If the TV set is on, it may be difficult to pin down which members are watching as some may claim not to be interested (although they may know quite a lot about that program). Alas, there must be some payment for these benefits and this is reflected in the higher variances of cluster sampling estimators over those of simple random sampling."

PPS sampling takes this a step further so that each element has its own probability of selection.\nThe procedure requires that an associated variable be known so that each element in the population has a measure of size associated with it. This variable may be a related variable whose values are known from a previous census. For example, auditors usually check only a sample of all the accounts in existence. The size of each account is crucial. So the large value accounts should be checked more intensely than the smaller accounts.

If we write the estimate of the population total as \\(\\hat{Y}\\), we have: \\[\\hat{Y}=N\\bar{y}= N\\sum \\frac{y_{i} }{n} =\\sum \\frac{y_{i} }{\\left({\\tfrac{n}{N}} \\right)}\\] Notice that the summation is over all observations in the sample. For simple random samples, the probability that each observation is selected is \\(\\frac{n}{N}\\) so that the estimate of the total is, indeed, the sum of each observation divided by its probability of selection.\nFor stratified sampling with \\(k\\) strata, the estimated total and mean are, respectively \\[\\hat{Y}=N_{1} \\bar{y}_{1} +N_{2} \\bar{y}_{2} +....+N_{k} \\bar{y}_{k}\\] and \\[\\bar{Y}=\\left(N_{1} \\bar{y}_{1} +N_{2} \\bar{y}_{2} +....+N_{k} \\bar{y}_{k} \\right)/N\\] Assume that stratum \\(j\\) contains \\(N_{j}\\) elements and that the sample size for this stratum is \\(n_{j}\\), then the probability that an element in the \\(j^{th}\\) stratum is selected is \\(\\frac{n_{j} }{N_{j} }\\). As an example, suppose that a stratified sample of adult males, in full time employment in NZ, was taken to determine the number of working days lost in the previous year and also their party political preference. In this hypothetical example, the strata are urban versus rural. The results were shown in Figure 5).\n\n\n\nFigure 5: STRS estimation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimate of total days lost \\(\\hat{Y}=N_{1} \\bar{y}_{1} +N_{2} \\bar{y}_{2} = 400,000\\times 5 + 100,000\\times 2 = 2,200,000.\\)\nThe estimate of the total number who prefer Labour is \\[\\hat{Y}=N_{1} p_{1} +N_{2} p_{2} = 400,000 \\times 0.5 + 100,000\\times 0.3 = 230,000.\\] Notice that proportions are means and fit into this structure quite naturally by defining\n\\[x_i = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} 1 & {{\\text{if the element has the property understudy}}} \\\\\n0 & {{\\text{otherwise}}} \\\\ \\end{array}} \\right.\\]\nNotice also that we could estimate \\(\\bar{y}\\) by \\(\\hat{Y}/N\\) so that:\nEstimate of total days lost per person = \\(\\hat{Y}/N\\) = 2,200,000/500,000 = 4.4.\nEstimate of proportions who prefer Labour = \\(\\hat{Y}/N\\) = 230,000/500,000 = 0.46.\nThese same formulae for estimating the population total and the population mean are appropriate for probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling. However, sampling without replacement makes the formulae rather complicated so we will not consider the details here."

    "text": "Multistage Designs and EPSEM\nLarge, and even moderately sized, sample surveys are often multistage surveys. The probability that an element is selected becomes the product of the probabilities of it being selected at each stage. As a simple example, consider 3 schools having 100, 200 and 300 students, respectively, and suppose that 12 students are to be selected from one of these schools. This could be carried out in a two-stage survey with the first stage being the selection of one school by probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling. In the second stage, 12 students are selected from the chosen school. Let \\(\\pi _{a}\\) be the probability of choosing a particular school and \\(\\pi _{b}\\) the probability of choosing a particular student (given that his/her school has been chosen). The probability of selecting a particular student is \\(\\pi_{a} \\times \\pi_{b}\\); see Figure 6.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: PPS example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, each student has the same probability of being selected which has been brought about by the PPS sampling of the schools. It would be possible, in this small example, to use only a one stage procedure such as a simple random sample of 12 students from a list of the 600. Alternatively each school could be viewed as a separate stratum and a stratified sample of students could be chosen. Of course, if 4 students are chosen from each school, those in the smallest school would have a better chance (4 chances in 100) of being selected than those in the largest school (4 chances in 300). On the other hand, if 2 are chosen from the first school, 4 from the next and 6 from the largest then each student will have the same probability of selection.\nThese EPSEM, equal probability of selection methods, have the advantage that it seems “fair” to allow each person the same probability of selection but, also, it makes for simpler and neater formulae for estimates and their variances."

    "text": "Other Sampling Methods\n\nVolunteers\nSamples are often selected because they are easy to obtain. Many psychology experiments referred to in the literature make use of long suffering students in introductory psychology courses. Quite often, volunteers are sought for experiments. Indeed, even when a probability sampling scheme is used, some subjects will withdraw so that the actual respondents are, in a sense, volunteers. Sometimes, people are accosted in the street or supermarket by market researchers or media reporters. The sample is by and large an opportunity sample for it is difficult to obtain a random sample under such conditions. Any generalisations from such a sample should be treated with some suspicion.\n\n\nSnowball samples\nA snowball sampling approach is used by medical authorities to track down possible sufferers of sexually transmitted diseases. All former contacts of a known sufferer are contacted, if possible, and former contacts of theirs also contacted. Both volunteer and snowball sampling are purposive methods in that no randomisation is employed.\n\n\nQuota samples\nAnother purposive sampling method is that of quota sampling. The idea is to make the sample representative of the population at least for certain variables. The quotas required in the sample may be decided by partitioning the sample into males and females, and also partitioning it by age groupings. The interviewer would be required to find the stipulated number of respondents in each cell of the sample. Although the sample is representative on the given variables, one is not sure how representative it is in terms of the responses obtained. Furthermore, being a purposive sample, it is difficult to make probability statements about estimators.\n\n\nEstimating wild life populations\nIt would be difficult to estimate the number of deer in a large untamed area such as some parts of the South Island. The target population of deer is very large but also is very hard to locate. One sampling approach would be to use recent deer droppings as a sampling frame, and for researchers to walk in a straight line noting the number of occurrences of droppings in (say) a 2 meter wide path. If the researchers are spaced at intervals of 20 meters then one could assume actual number of droppings of 10 times that obtained in the sample. Further assumptions would be needed to extrapolate from the number of droppings to the number of deer. A more direct approach would be afforded by a capture-recapture method in which a sample of animals is captured, tagged, released and then at a later date a further sample is captured. The proportion of tagged animals in this second sample indicates the size of the population. A number of assumptions must be made such as the uniform spread of the tagged animals throughout the areas of the second sampling. The initial capturing may affect the animals in unusual ways, by making them shy tending to avoid capture in future or making them tamer so that they do not fear capture as much on a subsequent occasion. The method of tagging may also be disadvantageous causing stress. Other assumptions need to be made about the distribution of the untagged and tagged animals. A number of different estimators have been suggested to obtain unbiased and efficient estimators of the number of animals in the population."

    "text": "Sample Size & Some Practical issues\nFigure 7 shows a fictitious example of how samples of four people are drawn from a population of 20 people.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Methods of Sampling: A toy example\n\n\nIn reality, sampling issues are not as simple as in the above example. Most large studies require quite a complex form of sampling involving layered sampling frames and combinations of design strategies. A typical design for an urban study is described below. The first layer consists of 20 regional areas; the second layer consists of all the municipalities within each regional area; the third layer consists of all the suburbs within each municipality; the fourth layer consists of all the city blocks within each suburb and the fifth layer consists of all the households within each city block. Judgement may be used to select only 5 of the 20 regional areas, one typical of the central regions, one each typical of the northern, southern, eastern and western regions. Next a systematic sample of municipalities is chosen (from a list sorted by postal code) for each of these regional areas, a sample of suburbs is chosen (stratified by socio-economic level) within each municipality, a simple random sample of city blocks is chosen within each suburb and a simple random sample of households is chosen within each city block. Such designs aim to be cost effective in terms of producing a representative sample at reasonable cost. However, complex designs require complex analyses, so try to keep things as simple as possible. The important criteria for the selection of an appropriate sample design are stratification, randomisation and cost. Note that non-response also has cost implications in that a survey with a high non-response rate is more costly than a survey with a good response rate. Of course the sample size also has an influence on cost and this provides opportunities for sample design/sample size trade-off. In the following discussion we assume that there is a 100% response rate. In other words sample size refers to the number of (good) sample elements. When only a 50% response rate is expected for a mail survey it means that the number of questionnaires distributed should be double the required sample size.\n\nSample Size\nUnfortunately, it is the available funds rather than research requirements that often determine what the sample size will be. We will therefore not ask the question How large a sample do we need? Instead we will ask What can a certain sample size \\((n)\\) do for us? The answer to this question depends on the sample design that is to be used. A quantity called a design effect \\((d)\\), related to the variance of the estimate, is used to measure the quality of a sample design. The larger the design effect (variance), the worse the design in terms of producing representative samples. The design effect is used to compute an effective sample size \\((e)\\) from the actual sample size \\({n}\\) using the formula \\({e=}\\frac{n}{d}\\). The effective sample size provides a more meaningful indication of the number of independent (useful) responses than the actual sample size. Figure 8 roughly shows the typical ranges for the design effect \\((d)\\) associated with the various sample designs.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Crude comparison of effective sample sizes\n\n\nFor a simple random sample the design effect is treated as one. So, for a simple random the effective sample size is the same as the actual sample size. Each observation in the sample is doing a full job. You will see that a quota sample typically has a design effect of 2, producing an effective sample size, which is half the actual sample size. This means that each observation in a quota sample is only doing half a job. However, in the case of a stratified random sample, the design effect is typically less than one indicating a very good design and producing an effective sample size that is greater than the actual sample size \\((n)\\). In this case each observation is working overtime. Clearly a design effect of more than one means that the sample is not as efficient as a random sample would be, while a design effect of less than one means that the sample if more efficient than a random sample would be.\nMost opinion polls give a margin of error (this term will be formally defined later on) when they give the result of their survey. This is the level of inaccuracy associated with the sample result. For example, we hear that a poll indicates that a proportion \\(p\\) of 40% of voters support National but the margin of error could be 6.1% if the effective sample size is only 300. When the purpose of the research is to estimate some proportion (i.e. percentage) then the margin of error can be calculated using an approximate formula (namely \\(2\\sqrt{p(1-p)/e}\\) where \\(p\\) is the expected proportion and e is the effective sample size). As indicated in Figure 9, the margin of error declines as the effective sample size increases. By setting \\(e\\) equal to the actual sample size divided by the design effect we can estimate the margin of error for any design. If the margin of error is too big it means that the sample size needs to be increased. Unfortunately this is usually the case. This example is hypothetical but it illustrates the general relationship between the margin of error and the effective sample size.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndfm &lt;- tibble(\n  \"Sample size\" = 30:1000,\n  \"Margin of error\" = 100/sqrt(`Sample size`)\n)\n\ndfm |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  aes(x = `Sample size`,\n      y = `Margin of error`) +\n  geom_path() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Margin of Error and Sample Size\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 9, the effective sample size required for a margin of error of 10% is 100. Since the actual sample size equals the effective sample size for a simple random sample this means that the size of the simple random sample must be 100 if the margin of error is 10% when a population proportion is estimated. However the effective sample size depends on the sample design. The actual sample size required for a given margin or error also depends on the sampling design. The actual sample size required in order for the margin of error to be 10 is highest for quota samples at 200 and lowest for a random stratified sample at 80. For the random cluster sample, an actual sample size of 120 will produce this margin of error.\nThe following rule of thumb can be used when sample results are to be generalised to a population. Firstly, if fairly sophisticated (multivariate analysis) is required then the effective sample size should be at least 200. Secondly, there should be at least four sample elements for every variable included in the study. However, this rule and the above formula are irrelevant when the population is relatively small or when we do not wish to generalise our findings to the population. In studies of this nature smaller sample sizes are sufficient. But the relative percentage to the size of the population should be large. For example if the population is of size only 100, an effective sample of size 80 is needed to achieve a certain degree of margin of error when the true population proportion is about 0.5. However, only an effective sample of size 370 is needed for the same margin of error if the population size is 10,000. The effective sample size needs to be increased only to 385 if the population size is 100,000. The moral is that percentage sampling is a fallacy, and that the absolute sample size is more important than sampling a fixed percentage of the population."

Make use of the search function (using the magnifying glass icon on the top-right of the page)—it will allow you to quickly locate any text you enter across the whole site.\nThere is a lot of material on this site. You’ll notice that the Study Guide is big, especially the first two chapters. But don’t panic! You can treat the lectures and workshops as the core, examinable material, and treat the Study Guide as a supplement. The Study Guide is so big because it goes a bit deeper into some of the topics.\nFeel free to use resources other than this site, particularly when coding (there are lots of links in the first workshop). The internet is full of Q & A about coding R. If you have a persistent error message, copy and paste it into an internet search engine with “R” or “Quarto”. Large language models (LLMs), such as Bard and ChatGPT, are also very powerful tools to help with coding, if you can accurately describe what you want in words. Be careful though – LLMs often give you code that doesn’t work, but they can be useful nonetheless."

An expected value of less than 5 may lead to concern and a very small value of less than 1 is a warning. Sometimes, you can merge/combine categories in case of small expected counts.\nIf the chi-squared statistic is small enough to be not significant, there is no problem.\nIf chi-squared statistic is significant, check the contributions to each cell. If cells with large expected value (&gt;5) contribute a large amount to chi-squared statistic, again there is no problem.\nIf cells with expected values less than 5 lead large contributions to chi-squared statistic, the significance of the chi-squared statistic should be treated with caution."

If one has access to the raw data (e.g. returned questionnaires), one can check observations by hand. If the raw data are not available, then the best one can do is to look for observations whose values are out of allowable ranges, or are very suspicious. A common problem occurs with the coding of missing information. Missing values are commonly recorded as a blank, *, -1, -999, or NA. Only one type of coding should be used. The use of NA is preferred since this is easier to spot. The use of blanks is particularly dangerous when one is exporting data from a spreadsheet to a text file. When the data from the text file is read into a computer package, a missing value may be skipped and the value from the next observation read in its place. When the data set is large, looking at a data set one observation at a time may not be feasible. In this case, plotting the data may show any observations with illegal values."

For instance, suppose that boxplots of the income of individuals in different age groups show that youngest and oldest age groups are the most different. If one elects to perform the hypothesis test for the difference between these two groups based on observations made during EDA, the resulting \\(p\\)-value is not valid.\nIn the sections below, we briefly review many common tools used to visualise data during EDA."

There is also evidence of an interior wall that may have separated the houses inside that wall from those outside the wall. Price and Griffin use differences in house size and artifacts composition to suggest that those distinctions may have reflected rank differences between the occupants of the two areas.\nThe distribution of number of Ceramics found can be displayed in the form of a bar chart; see Figure 1.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ntheme_set(theme_bw())\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata(Snodgrass, package = \"archdata\")\n\nSnodgrass |&gt; \n  ggplot() + \n  aes(x = Ceramics) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Bar Chart of Ceramics counts\n\n\n\n\nThe bar graph illustrates clearly that no ceramics were found in many houses but a lot were found in a few houses. This may be due to status and wealth of the occupants.\nNote that we are treating number of Ceramics as ordinal in the above graph. For nominal data software tend to order the categories alphabetically.\nHowever, a graph is not always the best way to display a small set of numbers. Graphs do have some disadvantages: they take up a lot of space, and they do not usually allow the recovery of the exact observations. For these reasons, particularly for a small data sets, a table is sometimes more effective. There were only three segment categories; and their counts can be simply displayed as a table.\n\n\nCode\ntable(Snodgrass$Segment)\n\n\n\n 1  2  3 \n38 28 25 \n\n\nIt would be interesting to see whether the discovery of ceramics is Segment dependent. In other words, we would like to explore two factors in display. This can be done in many ways (Figure 2).\n\n\nCode\ndata(Snodgrass, package = \"archdata\")\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(Snodgrass) +\n  aes(x = Ceramics, fill = Segment) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  ggtitle(\"Bar plot with colour grouping\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(Snodgrass) + \n  aes(x = Ceramics) + \n  geom_bar() + \n  facet_grid(vars(Segment)) + \n  ggtitle(\"Segment-wise Bar plots\")\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(Snodgrass) +\n  aes(x = Ceramics, fill = Segment) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Clustered Barplot\")\n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(Snodgrass) +\n  aes(x=Ceramics, fill = Segment) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") + \n  ggtitle(\"Clustered Bar plot - flipped\") +\n  scale_fill_grey() + coord_flip()\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Bar Chart of Ceramics counts by Segment\n\n\n\n\nIt is easy to spot that the Ceramics findings were largely from the first segment. This EDA conclusion can be drawn from all of the above plots. However, these bar plots do not rate the same as a “presentation style graphic”.\nTufte (2001) argues in favour of certain principles of graphical integrity for presentation style graphics. These are:\n\nThe representation of numbers in a graph should be directly proportional to the numbers themselves;\nClear and detailed labels should be used to prevent ambiguity;\nProvide explanations and important events pertaining to data on the graphic itself;\nThe graph should display data variation, not design variation—visual changes in the graph should be due to the data, not changes in way the data are drawn;\nThe number of dimensions used in the graph should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data;\nGraphs must not quote data out of context; for example, a monthly drop in the murder rate of a city should be plotted within the context of the murder rate over the last few years, or murder rates in comparable cities over the same period.\n\nA final point concerns the use of colour. In many sorts of graphs, data types are differentiated by the use of colour. This practice is perfectly legitimate, but one should be aware that a surprising proportion of people have impaired colour perception, such as being unable to distinguish between red and green (see here for colourblind-friendly pallettes). A remedy to these problems is to use different plotting symbols, line types, or shading, in conjunction with different colours. One should always make sure that the colours selected are clearly visible in the medium in which they are presented. Colours on a computer monitor can appear quite different when projected onto a screen in a lecture theatre, or when printed onto paper.\nAccording to Tufte (2001), a good graphical display should:\n\nDisplay the data;\nEncourage the viewer to concentrate on the substance of the data, in the context of the problem, not on the artistic merits of the graph;\nAvoid distorting, intentionally or unintentionally, what the data have to say;\nHave a high data to ink ratio; that is, convey the greatest amount of information in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space;\nEnable one to easily compare different pieces of data;\nReveal overall trends and patterns in the data that are not obvious from viewing the raw numbers;\nReveal detailed information secondary to the main trend; for example, the location of outliers, variability of the response.\n\nThis Chapter is largely concerned with EDA for discovery of patterns and peculiarities in a dataset. So we will not be too worried if the graphs produced are not aesthetically pleasing or does not meet a particular standard for a presentation style graph.\nThe end goal of most analyses is of course some form of written report or presentation. In either case, the findings of the study, should be supported by tables and graphs created during the EDA; these should clarify and support the final conclusions, not deceive or confuse the audience. One should refrain from showing all tables and plots that were created, but rather a careful selection that reinforces the main findings. The remaining figures can, if necessary, be placed in an appendix of the written report. The figures and tables that are shown should be well labelled and annotated. Abbreviations and cryptic variable names should be replaced by sensible labels and descriptions. The emphasis should be on conveying information rather than producing an eye catching plot. Special care should be taken to ensure that the table or graph cannot be easily misinterpreted.\nIn addition, a poorly made graph can be deceptive. This is a problem both in the understanding the data phase, and the presenting the data phase. One common mistake (but by no means the only one) in creating a graph is to use more dimensions to represent the data than there are data dimensions. For example, it is not uncommon to see a bar chart where the bars are drawn as three dimensional rectangular prisms. The false perspective actually obscures the differences in the heights of the bars.\nAnother pitfall is to use a clever graphic rather than one that clearly presents the data. The classic example of this is a pictogram, where pictures of varying size represent some quantities. Pictograms are often drawn dishonestly: to show a two-fold difference, each side of the picture is increased by a factor of two, so the area is in fact increased by a factor of four. Dishonesty in data presentation is clearly unacceptable. But even an honest pictogram is usually not the best way to present data. It is difficult to accurately judge differences between areas; which is what a pictogram asks the viewer to do."

Pie charts also have a poor accuracy of decoding. That means people’s impression of the difference in size between two pie slices is often quite different from the actual difference in size. Pie charts use angles to represent percentages; people tend to underestimate the size of acute angles and overestimate the size of obtuse angles. The exploded pie chart makes it more difficult to accurately compare pie slices: the exploded piece always appears bigger. The three dimensional pie chart is even worse. Bar charts, dot charts, or tables should be preferred to pie charts."

In a dotplot such points are usually stacked. As our eyes tend to pick up trends very easily, they tend to be distracted by the vertical changes. The main problem here is that some of the values which coincide by chance may be taken to represent real increases in density. To overcome this we try ‘jittering’ the data, which is equivalent to plotting a random number on the vertical axis against the data values on the horizontal axis. It is suggested that the vertical jitter be restricted to a small range so that the overall effect is that of a one-dimensional spread with greater, or lesser, density of points along the graph. Figure 4 shows a jittered dotplot. You can decide for yourself which strategy is better.\nClearly, the use of jittering is much more relevant for larger sets of data. Notice that with jittering we are interested in the relative density of the graph in different places rather than in trends.\nAs the vertical reading is determined at random our eyes may be distracted by a seeming trend which is mainly due to this randomness. For this reason, it is helpful to try more than one plot with different levels of jitter This is in the spirit of EDA, in which data is viewed from as many angles as is feasible. The other side of this coin is that conclusions from one display of data should be treated with some scepticism. The availability of computers allows data to be plotted, tabulated and transformed quickly, so we should look at it several ways to better appreciate the peculiarities inherent in our data.\nIn practice, one tends to avoid jittering except in (two-variable) scatter plots where there are many repeated \\((x, y)\\) points. Graphs with jitter are mainly needed when the data are heavily rounded, discrete, or grouped in some way, or there are a large number of points to be plotted.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A jittered dot plot"

    "text": "Histograms\nThe histogram is a standard method of showing the distribution of a quantitative variable. A histogram is made by dividing the range of a variable into “bins” and counting the number of data points that fall within each bin. It is like a bar chart after forcing a quantitative variable into bins. It can be used for discrete ungrouped data, but a bar chart is generally more suitable for discrete data because histograms can mislead the reader into thinking that values exist other than at the centre of the intervals.\nFigure 5 shows the histogram of Length. Clearly the distribution is far from symmetric and left skewed. The bimodal pattern also suggests subgrouping.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(Snodgrass) + \n  aes(x = Length) + \n  geom_histogram(bins=12, \n                 color=\"black\", \n                 fill=\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A typical histogram\n\n\n\n\nNotice that a different shape of histogram may result depending on the class intervals (bins) used (that is by choosing different class widths or different midpoints of the classes). This suggests that it may be wise to draw more than one histogram for a given data set particularly if statements are to be made about modes or gaps in the data. The guideline for the maximum number of intervals, \\(L\\), can follow the same formula as for stem-and-leaf displays. Some software use the Sturges (1926) formula namely \\[\\texttt{bin width} = \\frac {\\texttt{range}(x)} {\\log_2(n)+1}.\\] For fixing the width of the bins, the range of the data is divided by the sum of one and the base two logarithm of the sample size.\nThere are a few ways to scale the y-axis of a histogram, as shown in Figure 6:\n\nFrequency histograms show the counts in each bin; the heights of the bars sum to \\(n\\).\nRelative frequency histograms show the proportions or percent of data in each bin—the counts in each bin divided by the total; the heights sum to 1 or 100%.\nDensity histograms show the densities; the areas (heights \\(\\times\\) widths) of the bars sum to 1.\n\n\n\nCode\np1 &lt;-  Snodgrass |&gt; \n  ggplot() + \n  aes(x = Length) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +\n  ylab(\"\") + \n  ggtitle(\"(a) Frequency histogram\", \n          \"Heights of the bars sum to n\")\n\np2 &lt;-  Snodgrass |&gt; \n  ggplot() + \n  aes(x = Length) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    bins = 20, \n    mapping = aes(y = after_stat(count / sum(count)))\n    ) + \n  ylab(\"\") +\n  ggtitle(\"(b) Relative frequency histogram\",\n          \"Heights sum to 100%\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\np3 &lt;-  Snodgrass |&gt; \n  ggplot() + \n  aes(x = Length) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    bins = 20, \n    mapping = aes(y = after_stat(density))) +\n  ylab(\"\") + \n  ggtitle(\"(c) Density histogram\",\n          \"Heights x widths sum to 1\")\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\np1 + p2 + p3\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Three types of histograms\n\n\n\n\nIf, instead of drawing blocks over the class intervals as in a histogram, we join the mid points of the tops of the bars, we obtain a display known as a frequency polygon .

    "text": "Theoretical Distributions\nA histogram gives a general picture of the frequencies or relative frequencies of the data. If an observation is taken at random from the population from which the sample was drawn, the chance of it falling in any one of the class intervals should be approximately proportional to the area of the block over that interval (not exactly proportional because the histogram was only based on a sample from the population, not the population itself).\nIf we could draw a histogram for the whole population, then the probabilities would be exact. The relative frequencies form a probability distribution and if the class intervals are small enough the tops of the bars of the histogram would often approximate a smooth curve such as the density plot. In many cases this smooth curve is almost symmetrical with a rounded peak at the centre. One particular shape, fitting a certain mathematical formula, is a very good approximation to many sets of data. For instance, heights of people, weights of animals or yields of wheat all follow this distribution fairly well (although theoretically the distribution has an infinite range of possible values). One of the widely used theoretical distribution is called the Normal or Gaussian distribution but we will not bore you with its formula. However, most software can compute the tail areas (probabilities) under theoretical distributions. We shall study this distribution in greater detail in a Chapter 3. For the moment let us note that our EDA techniques should provide us with information about the parameters of the distribution, and we also want graphical techniques that display the continuous nature of the data.\nDiscrete data also have probability distributions and the bar graph gives a general picture of its shape. One commonly occurring discrete theoretical distribution is known as the Poisson distribution and approximates reasonably well the numbers of road accidents over a fixed time period. The main feature of a Poisson distribution is that there is a peak at the nearest integer below or equal to the average, and then a steady falling off. The mean is a parameter of the model, so we want our exploratory techniques to tell us about the mean, and to help us decide whether or not the Poisson model is appropriate for a given set of data. Theoretically, possible values are any whole positive numbers, but large numbers of accidents are very unlikely. Again, any graphical method we use must properly display the discrete nature of Poisson data. The other commonly adopted discrete distribution is the binomial distribution. This distribution is valid when the individual outcomes are classified into two categories such as Success and Failure."

As 50% of the observations fall between the first and third quartiles, the position of the box is important and is the first thing that catches our eyes. If the median is in the centre of the box, this suggests that the distribution may be symmetric; if the median is near one end, the distribution is skewed. In particular, if the median is in the right side of the box, it implies that the middle 50% of the data are skewed to the left. For right skewed data, the median will be placed at the left end of the box (as against in the centre of the box).\nAfter having considered the ‘centre’ of a distribution, which we have measured by the median, and looked at where the bulk of the data lies, measured by the quartiles; then we are particularly interested in the strange, unusual values. They could be obvious mistakes (incorrectly coded, or decimal places in the wrong place, transposition of digits such as 91 instead of 19) or incorrect measurements or recording. These last two possibilities often occur before the data gets to the statistician so that it may be difficult to check whether these mistakes have occurred. Apart from obvious errors, we can only point to ‘far out’ values as being strange and we term them ‘outliers’. To help decide this matter, we define a few more terms, of which the most common one is the interquartile range or IQR, which is the distance between the first and third quartiles ( \\(Q3-Q1\\) ). Any observation which is more than \\(1.5 \\times IQR\\) (sometimes called the “step”) less than the first or more than the third quartile can be considered a possible outlier (Figure 11.\nBoxplots are ideal for comparing a few groups of data because they give a visual summary of certain main features of the distributions but they are not as cluttered as other displays. Common sense must prevail, for there is a limit to the amount of information that the eye can take in.

If we assume that these are evenly spread throughout the distribution, these 91 values divide the distribution into 91 even parts each containing a relative frequency of 1/91 = 0.010989. In the absence of information about Length of other house pits, the above assumption seems reasonable. It would have even stronger justification if this sample of 91 were chosen at random from the population of the of all house pits, but this stretches the imagination somewhat as these 91 observations are just a chance archaeological find of what was preserved. Nevertheless, we have no real reason to consider that they are not representative of the whole population Snodgrass house pits.\nTo find the cumulative relative frequency, we divide the column of row numbers by 91. There is a slight problem in that we do not know the smallest, and the largest Length. Hence we make an arbitrary decision that the smallest is likely to be 4 feet with cumulative relative frequency of zero and the largest 21 feet with a cumulative frequency of 1.\nWith the Length data, there is a slight hitch in that there is duplication of the values. This is not really a problem, so long as we ignore the cumulative frequency in the table which corresponds to each first repeated value.

The test marks data can be graphed plotting English test scores against Mathematics test scores. The resulting graph, known as the scatterplot, is shown as Figure 17. This plot enables us to see if there is a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nHere, the scatterplot shows a clear upward trend – as the Mathematics mark increases so does the English mark, in general.\nThere are a number of useful features that can be added to a scatterplot. The individual distributions of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) can be shown by adding appropriate graphical displays (e.g. boxplots) along the axes. If a number of the students have the same marks then it may be advisable to add a jitter as we discussed earlier.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggExtra)\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(testmarks) + \n  aes(y=English, x=Maths) +\n  geom_point() + \n  coord_equal()\n\nggMarginal(p1, type=\"boxplot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: English vs Maths scores\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 18, it can be seen (with some effort) that each set of scores seems to be uniformly distributed along its axis, although the Maths marks exhibit gaps which may indicate different groups within the class.\nFinally, does the variability in English marks change as the Maths mark changes, or is it fairly constant, i.e. does the vertical height of the scatter change from left to right? In this case the variability appears to be fairly constant (we will see why this is important later).\nThe Rangitikei data gives the number of people making recreational use of the Rangitikei River and the number of vehicles seen at a particular location and time. The data were collected at two locations (location being a categorical variable).\n\n\nCode\nif( !file.exists(\"rangitikei.RData\") ) {\n\n  download.file(\n    url = \"http://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/rangitikei.RData\",\n    destfile = \"rangitikei.RData\")\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nload(\"rangitikei.RData\")\n\n\nIf the data are grouped, this information can be added to a scatterplot by using different symbols and/or colours for each group.

The first plot in Figure 20 (A) shows the scatter of all points, whereas the second one (B) shows the scatter with the very large value (Observation #26) removed. In the first plot, the outlier shows up quite clearly in both boxplots. In the second plot, the boxplot associated with the variable ‘people’ still shows one point as an outlier, though this doesn’t appear to be as extreme as the outlier in the first plot.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggExtra)\n\np1 &lt;- rangitikei |&gt; \n  ggplot() + \n  aes(y=people, x=vehicle) + \n  geom_point() +\n  ggtitle(\"(A): All of the data\")\n\np2 &lt;- rangitikei |&gt; \n  # remove the rows with highest value of 'people'\n  filter(people &lt; max(people)) |&gt; \n  ggplot() + \n  aes(y=people, x=vehicle) + \n  geom_point() + \n  ggtitle(\"(B): Without observation #26\")\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(\n  ggMarginal(p1, type=\"boxplot\"), \n  ggMarginal(p2, type=\"boxplot\"), \n  ncol=1)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: People vs vehicle plots\n\n\n\n\nNote that the outlier point in Figure 20 (A) showed clearly in the marginal distributions of both variables. However, it was consistent with the relationship between vehicle and people. While this might not surprise us (the relationship between people and vehicles might be expected to stay the same even for a location with large numbers of each), it follows that an outlier with respect to the underlying relationship between two variables will be different from an outlier in the marginal distribution sense. And such a value may not be an outlier in either marginal distribution.\nLook again at Figure 18 - there is one student with a high Maths mark but a low English mark. While neither mark is unusual in itself, the point stands out from the rest of the scatterplot because it is unusually high or low (i.e. up or down) on the plot. In general an outlier with respect to the relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is one whose \\(Y\\) value is unusually large or small compared to other cases with similar \\(X\\) values.\nNow let’s load the horsehearts dataset, which contains the weights of horses’ hearts along with some other heart measurements.\n\n\nCode\nif( !file.exists(\"horsehearts.RData\") ) {\n\n  download.file(\n    url = \"http://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/horsehearts.RData\",\n    destfile = \"horsehearts.RData\")\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nload(\"horsehearts.RData\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggExtra)\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(horsehearts) + \n  aes(y=WEIGHT, x=EXTDIA) + \n  geom_point()\n\np2 &lt;- p1 + geom_smooth(se=FALSE)\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(\n  ggMarginal(p1, type=\"density\"), \n  ggMarginal(p2, type=\"density\"), \n  ncol=1)\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Weight vs Exterior Widths\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21 shows scatterplots of weights of horses’ hearts against their exterior widths in the systolic phase (that is the contracted phase). The scatterplot indicates that a straight line would not fit the data well. On the other hand, there is some evidence the weights fall into one of two subgroups (with a value around 2.5kg being the cut off point). Scatterplots are particularly useful in pinpointing possible groupings of points so that the structure of the data is revealed which might otherwise go undetected in descriptive statistics calculated for the full data set.\nOne way of quickly assessing whether a straight line fit is reasonable is to smooth the points in the plot using a LOWESS (LOcally WEighted Scatterplot Smoother) smoothed line. The lowess (also called loess) procedure is based on local sets of points (instead of the whole data set) at a given \\(x\\) range, and fits a smoothed line to the data. The second scatterplot in Figure 21 shows the lowess smoother which confirms that there is curvature in the underlying relationship- possibly a cubic curve would fit this."

    "text": "Correlation coefficients\nAs we have seen before, scatterplots provide a good starting point for exploring the relationship between two variables. In Figure 22, the weight, \\(Y\\), is plotted against the exterior width \\(X\\) (diastolic phase in column 7 of horsehearts.txt). It is helpful to divide the scatterplot into four quarters, called quadrants, by drawing a line horizontally at the average \\(Y\\) value or weight (2.235 kg) and vertically at the average \\(X\\) value (or diastolic exterior width 14.13 mm). The first quadrant is the top right hand side quarter. We move anti-clockwise for numbering the quadrants, and the bottom left hand side quadrant is called the third quadrant.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Four quadrants of a scatter plot\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 22, most of the points fall in the third and first quadrants which indicates that there is an increasing relationship between the two variables (as the length increases, the weight tends to increase which is not too surprising!).\nAlthough this scatterplot indicates a nonlinear relationship would fit better than a linear relationship, we will continue to use it for illustration. It is useful to have an objective measure of how strong a linear relationship is (as we have seen, stretching or compressing one or both axes can give different impressions). This measure is called the Pearsonian correlation coefficient between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) and is denoted by \\(r_{xy}\\) or \\(r\\) for short:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nr_{xy} &= \\frac{{\\text {sum}(x - \\bar x)(y - \\bar y)}}{{\\text{squareroot}[\\text {sum}(x - \\bar x)^2  {\\text{sum}}(y - \\bar y)^2 ]}} \\\\\n\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sum (x-\\bar{x})(y-\\bar{y}) }{\\sqrt{\\sum (x-\\bar{x})^{2}  \\sum (y-\\bar{y})^{2}  } } \\\\\n\\\\\n&=\\frac{S_{xy} }{\\sqrt{S_{xx} S_{yy} } }\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHere \\(S_{xx}=S_x^2\\) is the variance of \\(X\\), \\(S_{yy}=S_y^2\\) is the variance of \\(Y\\), and \\(S_{xy}\\) is the covariance between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nThe Pearson correlation (coefficient) between WEIGHT and EXTDIA equals 0.759. Perfect correlation (+1) would occur if all points fell on a straight line in the first and third quadrants. Assuming a bivariate normal distribution, the null hypothesis that the true correlation coefficient \\(\\rho _{xy} =0\\) can be tested using the test statistic \\[t = \\frac{{r_{xy} }}{{\\sqrt {\\frac{{1 - r_{xy}^2 }}{{n - 2}}} }}\\] Statistical software programs directly give the \\(p\\)-value for this test. The estimated correlation coefficient of 0.759 for \\((n-2)=44\\) df is significant (\\(p\\)-value is close to zero). Testing of hypothesis related topics are covered in the next Chapter.\nThe scatterplot indicates that there may be two groups of horses; whose hearts weigh about 2.3 kg or more and whose heart weights are less than 2.3 kg. If possible, one should try to establish whether there are two groups for some reason (perhaps age, sex or breed). If the points tended to concentrate in quadrants 2 and 4, this would indicate that the correlation between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) is negative (as \\(X\\) increases, \\(Y\\) tends to decrease). If the points were evenly scattered among the four quadrants, the correlation coefficient would be close to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Limitations of the correlation coefficient\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23 shows a number of possible plots of \\(Y\\) against \\(X\\) and their associated correlation coefficients. Notice that the correlation coefficient may be close to zero even though there is a strong pattern present. This is because the correlation coefficient only measures the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. In the presence of subgroups the correlation coefficient can become spurious or even be close to zero when there is indeed the correlation is high within the subgroup. Simpson (1951) demonstrated that relationships noted within a population may not hold and could be the opposite within all subgroups. This amalgamation paradox can happen to most summary statistical measures including the correlation coefficient.\nThe other situation that is not shown in Figure 23 is that the correlation coefficient can be positive and a line would be a reasonable fit although the scatter diagram indicates that both \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) have skewed distributions suggesting that transformations should be applied.\n\n\n\nFigure 24: Sign of the correlation coefficient\n\n\nTo see why the sign of \\(r\\) indicates the direction of the relationship, consider Figure 24.\n\nRegardless of which quadrant the point is in, the contribution to \\(S_{xx}\\) and \\(S_{yy}\\) is positive, as these are sums of squares.\nIn the first quadrant the contribution of each point to the cross product \\(S_{xy}\\) is \\((+) \\times (+)\\), that is a positive amount. In the third quadrant, each contribution is \\((-)\\times (-)\\), that is a positive amount. This is the reason that the correlation coefficient is positive if most points are in the first and third quadrants.\nPoints in the second and fourth quadrant contribute negative amounts, \\((-)\\times (+)\\) or \\((+)\\times (-)\\), to the cross product \\(S_{xy}\\). If there are a considerable number of points in quadrants 2 and 4, the correlation coefficient will tend to be negative."

Even though the correlations are high, a quadratic model may fit better. Figure 25 seems to show a non-random pattern in the way points appear on the plot.

What this means is that several combinations of X and Y can lead to the same Z. So we have to use some smoothing method or a model to obtain the contours and form a grid.

    "text": "Populations and parameters, samples and statistics\nStatistical inference is a fundamental concept in statistics. The vast majority of statistical analyses that you will do as an undergraduate involve statistical inference. Anything involving p-values, confidence intervals, or standard errors are a form of statistical inference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical inference is:\n\n\n\nthe use of information from a sample to make statements about a population.\n\n\nAs discussed in previous chapters, most datasets contain information about a sample from a population, rather than the whole population of interest. For example (Figure 1), say we owned a fish farm, and we wished to know the average length of the fish in our farm. Let’s say we had 2,000 fish in our farm. It would be too time-consuming to catch and measure every single fish. Instead, we take a random sample of, say, 10 fish, measure their lengths, and calculate the mean.\nRemember, our goal here is to know something about the whole population of 2,000 fish. We don’t really care about the 10 fish in our sample. It is no use to say “Well, I’ve no idea about the average length of my whole population fish, but you see those 10 fish there? They average 36.7 cm in length.”. We only care about the 10 fish in our sample in so far as they tell us something about the broader population. We use the average length of the fish in our sample as and estimate of the average length of fish in the population. This is statistical inference: using information from a sample to make conclusions about a population.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Statistical inference from a sample to a population of fish\n\n\nTo clarify some terminology using the example in Figure 1:\n\nThe population is all 2,000 fish in our farm.\nThe sample is the 10 fish we happened to measure.\nThe parameter of interest (often denoted \\(\\mu\\), if it is a mean, or \\(\\theta\\) more generally) is the average length of the fish in the population of 2,000. Population parameters are usually considered to be fixed and unknown values.\nThe statistic (often denoted \\(\\bar{y}\\) or \\(\\hat\\mu\\), if it is a mean, or \\(\\hat\\theta\\) more generally) is the average of the 10 lengths of the fish in our sample. Unlike population parameters, which are fixed and unknown, sample statistics are random variables.\nStatistical inference in this case is the use of the sample mean \\(\\bar{y}\\) as an estimate of the population mean \\(\\mu\\).\n\nThe fact that we’ve only measured lengths from a sample rather than the whole population necessitates statistical inference. If we’d measured every fish in the farm, we wouldn’t need statistical inference, because we’d know precisely the population parameter (assuming negligible measurement error)."

    "text": "Sampling Error\nThis brings us to the next important concept of statistical inference: sampling error. A consequence of having collected data from a sample rather than the whole population is that there is uncertainty in our knowledge of the population parameter. Our sample mean is an estimate of the population mean; if we wanted to know population mean with zero uncertainty, we’d have to measure all the fish. This is the trade-off of sampling. It’s a lot cheaper to sample, but we sacrifice certainty.\nThe practical application of statistical inference involves (1) making estimates and (2) quantifying the uncertainty of those estimates. Uncertainty is often quantified using standard errors, confidence intervals, and P-values. All these quantities relate to sampling error. They’re all expressions of the uncertainty of an estimate of a population parameter.\nIn the fish farm example (Figure 1), sampling error is the hypothetical variation in the means of the lengths of samples of fish, with a sample size of \\(n\\) = 10. That is, if we were to (hypothetically) repeat the scientific process (i.e., randomly select 10 fish, measure their lengths, and calculate the sample mean), over and over again, how much would those sample means vary? That variation of sample statistics is sampling variation, or sampling error. And understanding sampling variation is the key to understanding most of undergraduate statistics.\nSo, when we do our study (i.e., randomly select 10 fish, measure their lengths, and calculate the sample mean), we are drawing one value of the sample mean, \\(\\bar y\\), from a random variable, \\(\\bar Y\\), which is the distribution of sample means that we could hypothetically draw.\nGiven this random sampling variation, here are some explanations for some commonly used measures of uncertainty:\n\nA standard error is simply the standard deviation of a statistic under repeated sampling–that is, how much it would vary (hypothetically) from sample to sample.\nA confidence interval is a pair of numbers that contain the true value of the population parameter with 95% confidence. It is a simple function of the sample statistic and its standard error.\nA p-value is the probability of obtaining a sample statistic as or more extreme than the one observed, given a particular hypothesised value (usually zero) of the population parameter.\n\nDon’t worry if those definitions aren’t completely clear to you right now, but I encourage you to refer back to this section again and again as you learn about them in more detail during the rest of this course.\nKeep sampling error front of mind whenever you see a standard error, a confidence interval, or a p-value.\nNow, we’ll introduce some specific inference methods."

The boxplot again suggests a very mild skew to the left but the middle 50% data show right skewness. However the whiskers are about the same length and there are no outliers. There is a difference of 31 between the mean and median, suggestive of a slight skew to the lower values. However this difference is small given the overall variability (standard deviation is 567.9, and the range is 2309) so we can probably ignore the observed skew. However we will look for any further evidence of skewness, since this could invalidate any inference we make based on the Normal distribution (at least it would if we had a smaller sample). The TV viewing time data also passes normality tests such as Shapiro-Wilk test. All told, we conclude that the normal model describes the distribution of these data fairly well.\nAs indicated earlier, a large number of naturally occurring measurements, such as height, appear to follow a Normal distribution so that a considerable amount of theory has been built on this distribution.\nTo recapitulate, Normal (or Gaussian) curves are determined by just two numbers, one indicating the location and the other the spread. Although there are an infinite number of Normal curves, their shapes are similar and, of course, the area under each curve is 1. Indeed, the location and spread parameters are the only differences between curves.\nIt is usual to take the measure of location as the mean, denoted by \\(\\mu\\), and the measure of spread as the standard deviation, denoted by \\(\\sigma\\). If a variable, Y, follows a Normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), we write Y \\(\\sim\\) N(\\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\)) where \\(\\sim\\) means is distributed as (The squiggly symbol \\(\\sim\\) is known as tilde).\nNote, again, that the normal distribution, like all statistical distributions, is a theoretical concept and no naturally occurring measurement will exactly follow a probability distribution model. For one thing, any measurement is finite whereas the Normal curve is continuous in the interval \\(\\left(-\\infty ,\\infty \\right)\\). Also, the curve is asymptotic to the \\(X\\)-axis so that any range of values of \\(Y\\) however large or small will have a certain probability according to the Normal distribution, but in practice there will be limitations such as that a person’s blood pressure must be greater than zero.\nSuppose we didn’t know that \\(\\mu\\) = 80 and \\(\\sigma\\) = 12. The obvious estimator of \\(\\mu\\), based solely on the sample, is the sample mean \\(\\bar{y}\\), and the obvious estimator of \\(\\sigma\\) is the sample standard deviation \\(S\\). Note that by estimator we don’t mean the observed value based on the particular sample. Rather the word estimator means the mathematical formula or procedure that we use to produce our estimates, namely \\(\\bar{y}={\\frac{1}{n}} \\sum y\\) and \\(S=\\sqrt{{\\frac{1}{n-1}} \\sum _{i=1}^{n}(y_{i} -\\bar{y})^{2} }\\).\nThe point is that there can be several alternative procedures for estimating the same parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\), and in particular samples the actual computed estimates may be the same or different. For example, since the mean and median are the same for Normal data, we could estimate \\(\\mu\\) by the sample median, namely 81.313 for our example. This different procedure has given rise to a different number, and if we didn’t know the answer we would not know which estimate to use. The median estimate has a lot of attraction, since the median is robust, that is, is not affected by outliers.\nClearly all these estimates are close to the true parameter values, but not the same. A statistical question relates to how close estimates are to their true values in general. We usually can’t answer this question about the actual estimates (observed numbers) since we usually don’t know the correct answer. One approach, which is often used to test procedures in research, is to try a number of simulations and see which approach produces the closest results on average. We can also give error bounds that say, for example, that 95% of the time the estimator is within such-and-such a distance of the true parameter. This leads to the idea of using probability or so-called ‘confidence’. By making probability statements about the estimators we can say something useful about how trustworthy the particular estimates are also. We use standard errors to measure the trustworthiness of the estimators. The standard error is the standard deviation of the estimator, so the smaller the standard error the better.\nWithout going into details, it turns out that \\(\\bar{y}\\) has the smallest possible standard error for any unbiased estimator of \\(\\mu\\) for normal data. (An unbiased estimator is one that is not systematically too big or too small.) While the same is not true of \\(S\\) in relation to \\(\\sigma\\), the latter does have other useful mathematical properties. So these are some reasons for using these formulae so routinely."

    "text": "Hypothesis testing for mean\nFor testing the mean of a population, the fact that we have specified a parameter value in \\(H_0\\) enables us to specify a probability distribution, for example that the data are a random sample from N(\\(\\mu_0\\), \\(\\sigma\\)). This immediately implies that\n\\(t = \\frac{\\bar{y}-\\mu _{0} }{S/\\sqrt{n} } \\sim t{}_{n-1}\\)\nNow if the hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true, we should have \\(\\mu\\cong\\mu_0\\) . The notation equal-with-squiggle, \\(\\cong\\), stands for “approximately equal to” ), so that \\(t\\) should generally be close to 0. If the hypothesis is false we should get either much less than \\(\\mu_0\\) or much greater than \\(\\mu_0\\), in which case \\(t\\) should be large, out in the tails of the \\(t_{n-1}\\) distribution. Since we have a probability distribution, we can quantify just how unlikely our particular \\(t\\) is by comparing our sample value with the distribution.\nLet’s make things more specific by considering the television example. The degrees of freedom are \\(n-1 = 45\\). We have already indicated that \\(t\\cong0\\) implies \\(\\mu\\cong\\mu_0\\), in other words that the data matches the hypothesis very closely. But suppose instead we observed \\(t= 0.68\\). Could we regard this as an unusually large value of \\(t\\), that is, as evidence against \\(H_0\\)? The answer is no! The reason is that 0.68 is the upper quartile of the \\(t_{45}\\) distribution; in other words half (50%) of the time we would see values of \\(t\\) either greater than 0.68 or less than -0.68, even if the hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true. Now what if \\(t\\) were below -1.6794? Would that be regarded as an unusual amount of discrepancy between \\(t\\) and \\(\\mu\\), that is as evidence against \\(H_0\\)? The answer is maybe. The fact is that 10% of the time one sees \\(t\\) \\(&lt;-1.6794\\) or \\(t&gt;1.6794\\), even if \\(H_0\\) is true. So if we use this rule, we have a 10% chance of wrongly rejecting \\(H_0\\). Few New Zealanders would feel happy with a legal system that allowed a 10% chance of wrongfully convicting an innocent person. Finally, what if we observe \\(t= -2.6896\\)? Only 1% of the area under the \\(t_{45}\\) curve lies outside the interval -2.6896 to +2.6896, so we would conclude that such a value of \\(t\\) was quite unlikely. This then would be strong evidence against \\(H_0\\).\nSuppose now we test the extremely unlikely hypothesis \\(H_0:\\mu = 0\\). Since \\(S/\\sqrt n=83.7\\), we obtain \\(t = (1729.3-0)/83.7 = 20.65\\). This is far larger than could be expected by chance, so the \\(t\\) statistic provides clear evidence against \\(H_0\\).\nA more realistic test may be whether \\(H_0:\\mu = 1500\\). Perhaps a previous study found an average time of viewing of 1500 minutes per week, and we want to check this. The test statistic is: \\(t=(1729.3-1500)/83.7=2.74\\). This is just outside our 1% bounds established earlier, so we conclude the data and \\(H_0\\) do not seem to agree. We reject \\(H_0:\\mu=1500\\).\nFinally suppose we test the hypothesis \\(H_0:\\mu=1600\\). Again this hypothesis could have been prompted by a previous study. Then \\(t=(1729.3-1600)/83.7=1.54\\). This is within the interval -1.6794 to 1.6794, suggesting that 1.54 is not an unusually highly value since it is exceeded more than 10% of the time when \\(H_0\\) is true. We would not reject the hypothesis \\(H_0:\\mu = 1600\\).\nWhen statistical test of hypothesis is done using R software, we rely on the \\(p\\)-value displayed.\n\n\nCode\nt.test(tv$TELETIME, mu=1500)\n\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  tv$TELETIME\nt = 2.7382, df = 45, p-value = 0.008818\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1500\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 1560.633 1897.932\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 1729.283 \n\n\nSo what is a \\(P\\)-value? Formally, A P-value is the probability of observing data as extreme or more extreme as the data you actually observed, if \\(H_0\\) is true. This sounds like a very abstract and difficult concept to grasp, but it’s in fact exactly the rule we have been using. We saw that 50% of the time, \\(t&lt;-0.68\\) or \\(t&gt;0.68\\). So the \\(p\\)-value for a \\(t=0.68\\) is 0.5. We saw that 10% of the time, \\(t&lt;-1.6794\\) or \\(t&gt;1.6794\\). So the \\(p\\)-value of \\(t= -1.6794\\) is 0.1. And we saw that 1% of the time \\(t&lt;-2.6896\\) or \\(t&gt;2.6896\\), so the \\(p\\)-value of \\(t=2.6896\\) is 0.01. What is the \\(p\\)-value of \\(t= 2.74\\)? The answer is 0.009 or just under 1%. What is the \\(p\\)-value of \\(t= 1.54\\)? Answer is 0.130.\nUsually, we reject \\(H_0\\) in favour of \\(H_{1}\\) if the \\(p\\)-value of the data is \\(&lt; 0.05\\). In this case the test is said to be significant, and the 0.05 is called the significance level of the test. Otherwise (when we don’t reject \\(H_0\\)) we call the test non-significant. Some refer to a \\(p\\)-value \\(&lt;0.01\\) as very significant or highly significant. In journal articles and published tables of results, the three case non-significant, significant, and highly significant are often abbreviated as NS, * and ** respectively. The issues of using a standard cut-off of 5% for significance level, largely insisted in journals, has had its unintended consequences. The false discovery in science can be avoided if P values are not used as the sole criterion to draw conclusions. Read the advice on P values presented next.\nAdvice on the use of P values\nUnfortunately the P-values are often misunderstood in practice. The advice issued by the American Statistical Association (https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/P-ValueStatement.pdf) is noteworthy:\n\nThe statement’s six principles, many of which address misconceptions and misuse of the p-value, are the following:\n\nP-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model.\nP-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.\nScientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold.\nProper inference requires full reporting and transparency.\nA p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result.\nBy itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis.\n\n\nIn order to fully appreciate the reasons behind the above advice, we need learn more theory but you should be able to understand the following distinction between statistical significance and practical significance. A hypothesis test may suggest that the estimated size of the effect is not big enough compared to the effect that can occur due to errors under the assumed model. A small effect, particularly if it is known to be caused by a variable, can be of practical importance and can contribute to scientific knowledge. The opposite scenario is also possible. We may find a small difference to be statistically significant because of the large sample size but such a difference may not be of much practical significance.\nA hypothesis test has a certain power (probability) to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. This power (probability) is a function of the sample size and the unknown parameters of the probability model adopted for testing.\nAssume that we are testing the null hypothesis \\(H_0:\\mu = 0\\) using the null model \\(N(0,1)\\). The power of the one sample t test can be evaluated using the R function power.t.test() for a given \\(\\delta\\), the difference in the true mean and what was hypothesised under \\(H_0\\). For example, the power of the \\(t\\)-test for \\(n=30\\) is lower than the power when \\(n=50\\) (say) when other settings are the same. Try-\n\n\nCode\npower.t.test(n = 30, delta = 1, sd = 1, sig.level = 0.05)\npower.t.test(n = 50, delta = 1, sd = 1, sig.level = 0.05)\n\n\nThe power to detect a small change in the mean is often low. Try-\n\n\nCode\npower.t.test(n = 30, delta = .25, sd = 1, sig.level = 0.05)\npower.t.test(n = 30, delta = 1, sd = 1, sig.level = 0.05)\n\n\nThere is a trade-off between the significance level (Type I error or false positive) and Type II error or false negative (=1-power) probabilities. Try-\n\n\nCode\npower.t.test(n = 30, delta = 0.5, sd = 1, sig.level = 0.05)\npower.t.test(n = 30, delta = 0.5, sd = 1, sig.level = 0.01)\n\n\nWhen we test many hypothesis in tandem, we are more concerned on the overall or family-wise error rates. The issues of false discovery in science is discussed in a later section.\nP hacking is a phrase used when a particular test or a meta procedure is deliberately chosen either to ensure a low p-value or just to achieve a value below 0.05."

    "text": "Hypothesis tests for two groups\nThe null hypothesis is that population means of the two groups are equal (written as \\(H_0:\\mu_1 = \\mu_2\\) or \\(H_0:\\mu_1-\\mu_2=0\\)). The alternative hypothesis is that the population means of the two groups are different (i.e., \\(H_0:\\mu_1\\neq \\mu_2\\) or \\(H_0:\\mu_1-\\mu_2\\neq0\\)). Note that when the two population means are different either \\(\\mu_1&gt;\\mu_2\\) or \\(\\mu_1&lt;\\mu_2\\).\nThe difference in sample means \\(\\bar{y}_{1} -\\bar{y}_{2}\\) can be standardized to give a \\(t\\) statistic:\n\\(t\\) = ((\\(\\bar{y}_{1} -\\bar{y}_{2}\\))- expected)/e.s.e.\nThe test statistic is \\((\\bar{y}_{1} -\\bar{y}_{2})\\), which has the expected value of zero under the null hypothesis.\nThe estimated standard error (e.s.e) of (\\(\\bar{y}_{1} -\\bar{y}_{2}\\)), is obtained in two ways depending on whether it is plausible or not to make the assumption that the variances within the populations are the same, (i.e. \\(\\sigma _{1}^{2} =\\sigma _{2}^{2}\\)). Whether this assumption appears to be tenable or not can be explored using boxplots etc. For the television viewing time example, the variances of the TV viewing times do not appear to be the same for boys and girls. If the variances of the two populations are the same, then we will use a method of combining the individual variances of the groups to form a pooled variance estimate. To do this, we cannot simply average the two variances as the sample sizes may be quite different. A weighted sum is called for to give:\npooled estimate of variance, \\(S_{p}^{2} =w_{1} S_{1}^{2} +w_{2} S_{2}^{2}\\)\nwhere the weights are, \\(w_{1} =\\frac{n_{1}-1}{n_{1} +n_{2}-2}\\) and \\(w_{2} =\\frac{n_{2}-1}{n_{1} +n_{2}-2}\\). Hence the pooled estimate of the standard deviation is given by\n\\(S_p = \\sqrt{ w_1S_{1}^2 + w_2S_{2}^2 }\\) or\n\\[S_{p} =\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(n_{1}-1\\right)S_{1}^{2} +\\left(n_{2}-1\\right)S_{2}^{2} }{n_{1} +n_{2} -2} }\\] Consequently,\nEstimated standard error (\\(\\bar{y}_{i}\\))=\\(\\frac{S_{p}}{\\sqrt{n_{i}}},~~~i = 1, 2\\)\nso that\nEstimated standard error (\\(\\bar{y}_{1}-\\bar{y}_{2}\\))=\\(S_{p} \\sqrt{1/n_{1}+1/n_{2}}\\)\nIf the variances of the two populations are not the same, then we cannot pool the variances. Hence the estimated standard error for the difference in the two sample means is given by\nEstimated standard error (\\(\\bar{y}_{1}-\\bar{y}_{2}\\))=\\(\\sqrt{\\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}} +\\frac{S_{2}^{2}}{n_{2}}}\\)\nThe degrees of freedom for our \\(t\\)-test (called the two-sample \\(t\\) test) depends on whether estimated standard error is based on the pooled variance or not. For the variance pooled case, the \\(df\\) for the \\(t\\)-test is \\(n_{1}+n_{2}-2\\) but becomes smaller for the unpooled case to \\[df=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}} +\\frac{S_{2}^{2} }{n_{2}} \\right)^{2} }{\\frac{1}{n_{1} -1} \\left(\\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}}\\right)^{2} +\\frac{1}{n_{2} -1} \\left(\\frac{S_{2}^{2}}{n_{2} } \\right)^{2}}\\] That is, the \\(df\\) is adjusted according to the ratio of the two variances. The \\(t\\)-test is also approximate when the variances are not pooled and hence it would be advisable to perform a transformation as later outlined in this Chapter.\nHand calculations for the two sample \\(t\\)-test are cumbersome. The test done on computer usually gives us an output which contains the \\(t\\)-statistic value and the associated \\(p\\)-value. Supplementary details such as the standard errors of the sample means, and their difference, associated \\(df\\) etc will also be contained. The R output given below shows the two-sample test results for the TV viewing data set. Here we test whether the true mean TV viewing times are the same for boys and girls.\n\n\nCode\nt.test(TELETIME~SEX, data=tv)\n\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  TELETIME by SEX\nt = -0.7249, df = 40.653, p-value = 0.4727\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 1 and group 2 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -462.1384  218.0514\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 1 mean in group 2 \n       1668.261        1790.304 \n\n\nBased on the EDA evidence seen in Figure 6, we may take a conservative stand and prefer the unpooled two-sample \\(t\\)-test (which is also known as Welch Two Sample t-test). The \\(t\\)-value of -0.72 is not unusual as the probability of getting such an extreme value under the null hypothesis is \\(p=0.47\\). In other words, we cannot reject the null hypothesis; we accept it until we have more evidence to the contrary. Hence the conclusion of the \\(t\\)-test is that the mean TV viewing times can be regarded as the same for the population of boys and girls. Alternatively there is no statistically significant gender effect on TV watching for boys and girls of Standards 2 to 4."

    "text": "Transformation and shape\nWhen considering data, we may decide to use the measurements as they are, or we may rescale them. For example, we may change them to percentages of the total. As a simple example, consider a town with four stores in which the weekly turnovers are one, two, four and eight thousand dollars. These could be rescaled to percentages of the total (which is 15).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw data\n1\n2\n4\n8\n\n\nData in %\n1/15 \\(\\times\\) 100= 6.7%\n2/15 \\(\\times\\) 100 = 13.3%\n4/15 \\(\\times\\) 100= 26.7%\n8/15 \\(\\times\\) 100= 53.3%\n\n\n\nIf you were to compare a dotplot of the original data with a dotplot of the rescaled data you would find that the shape of the data had not changed by this rescaling. That is, the second percent is twice the first and the second weekly turnover is almost twice the first; the third percent is four times the first and twice the second and so on. This is an example of a linear transformation.\nA linear transformation is one that can be described by the formula, \\(y=a+bx\\) for certain constants \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and where \\(x\\) is the old data and \\(y\\) is the transformed data. The key thing about linear transformations is that they do not change the shape of a dotplot, only the scale. Another linear example is converting temperature data from Fahrenheit (\\(x\\)) to centigrade \\(y = 5(x-32)/9\\). Boxplots of the temperatures would look the same even though the scale was altered.\nAnother way of rescaling the store example would be to calculate the weekly turnover of a store divided by the number of employees in that store, to give weekly turnover per employee. Even though this looks like a linear transformation it is not, since the relative positions of the four stores on a scale would change depending on the number of employees. If we have two or more variables (e.g. turnover, employees) it is often useful to look at ratios like this to seek simple explanations of the data.\n\n\nCode\nrht &lt;- data.frame(RHT=rbeta(1e3, 1,5))\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(rht) + \n  aes(RHT) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  xlab(\"\") + ylab(\"\") +\n  ggtitle(\"(a) Needs a Shrinking Transformation\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(rht) +\n  aes(y=RHT, x=\"Right Skewed Data\") +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  xlab(\"\") + ylab(\"\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\nlht &lt;- data.frame(LHT=rbeta(1e3, 5,1))\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(lht) +\n  aes(LHT) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  xlab(\"\") + ylab(\"\") + \n  ggtitle(\"(a) Needs a Stretching Transformation\")\n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(lht) +\n  aes(y=LHT, x=\"Left Skewed Data\") +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  xlab(\"\") + ylab(\"\") +\n  coord_flip()\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p3, p2, p4, ncol=2) \n\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

    "text": "The Ladder of Powers\nFrom now on we assume that the data are very skewed, and we wish to transform it, (or, in Tukey’s terms, re-express it) to be as symmetrical as possible. A simple approach considers the data raised to different powers, that is, if the original data are \\(x\\) and the new data are \\(y\\),\n\\[y =\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l} {\n\\text {sign} (\\lambda )x^\\lambda~~~~~ \\lambda \\ne 0} \\\\\n{\\log(x)~~~~~~~~~~~\\lambda = 0} \\end{array} \\right.\\]\nNote that the Greek letter \\(\\lambda\\) is pronounced as lambda. Here, (\\(\\text {sign}(\\lambda)\\)) is +1 if \\(\\lambda&gt;0\\), and \\(\\text {sign}(\\lambda)=-1\\) if \\(\\lambda&lt;0\\), for reasons discussed below. Some special cases of this power transformation are set out below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOWER\nFormula\nName\nResult\n\n\n\n\n3\n\\(x^3\\)\ncube\nstretches large values\n\n\n2\n\\(x^2\\)\nsquare\nstretches large values\n\n\n1\n\\(x\\)\nraw\nNo change\n\n\n1/2\n\\(\\sqrt{x}\\)\nsquare root\nsquashes large values\n\n\n0\n\\(\\log{x}\\)\nlogarithm\nsquashes large values\n\n\n-1/2\n\\(\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{x}}\\)\nreciprocal root\nsquashes large values\n\n\n-1\n\\(\\frac{-1}{x}\\)\nreciprocal\nsquashes large values\n\n\n\nRaising the data to the power of 1 does not change it at all; as we proceed down or up from 1, the strength of the transformation increases. The special case \\(\\lambda\\)=0 has to be handled differently since \\(x^0=1\\) for all non-zero \\(x\\). Instead we conventionally regard it as being equivalent to taking the natural logarithm because the transformation \\(\\frac{x^{\\lambda } }{\\lambda } -\\frac{1}{\\lambda }\\) is close to the logarithmic transformation if \\(\\lambda\\) is small. The ‘common’ logarithm to base 10 could be used but it just yields a constant multiple of the natural logarithm (ln = log to the base \\(e\\)). Now regarding the \\(\\text {sign}(\\lambda)\\): Notice that with two numbers, say 2 and 5, the reciprocal transformation would yield 0.5 and 0.2 so that, whereas the original numbers are increasing in size the transformed values are decreasing. To keep the order the same we take the negative of the reciprocal values, -0.5 and -0.2. These are again increasing. The same principle holds for all transformations where \\(\\lambda\\) is negative. \\(\\text {sign}(\\lambda)\\) is employed to keep the order the same as the raw data. (Alternatively we could divide by \\(\\lambda\\) which is consistent with the case of power zero that is the logarithm transformation).\n\n\nCode\np1 &lt;- ggplot(rangitikei) +\n  aes(y=vehicle^2, x=\"\") +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  xlab(\"\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  ggtitle(\"Square Transformation\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(rangitikei) +\n  aes(y=vehicle, x=\"\") +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  xlab(\"\") + \n  coord_flip() + \n  ggtitle(\"Raw Data\")\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(rangitikei) +\n  aes(y=vehicle^.5, x=\"\") + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  xlab(\"\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  ggtitle(\"Square-root Transformation\")\n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(rangitikei) + \n  aes(y=log(vehicle), x=\"\") + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  xlab(\"\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  ggtitle(\"log Transformation\")\n\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p3,p2, p4, ncol=2) \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Effect of Transformations\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, the boxplots in Figure 9 represent the number of vehicles at the two Rangitikei river locations (from rangitikei). The first boxplot shows the square of the number of vehicle, which is highly right-skewed. The second boxplot shows the raw data (vehicle) which are still skewed towards the larger values. So to squash these to make the distribution more symmetric, the ladder of powers suggests we could try a square root transformation, or a stronger one such as the logarithm (or reciprocal root). These are shown in the third and fourth boxplots."

    "section": "Some Words of Caution About Transformations",
    "text": "Some Words of Caution About Transformations\n\nIf the data set is small, transformations should be approached with some scepticism, for if more data were available the shape of the distribution may change.\nIt should be kept in mind that there are different levels at which data can be considered such as (a) just a collection of numbers (any reasonable transformation would suffice); (b) referring to physical quantities (certain transformations may make physical sense and allow meaningful interpretations to be made) and (c) outcomes from a certain process (for example, frequencies or counts may often suggest a Poisson distribution for which a square root transformation is suitable). The choice of a transformation may depend on the additional information that is known about the batch of data.\nCommon sense should prevail in this area as a transformation which brings only marginal improvement to symmetry, for example, should be balanced against other drawbacks such as the difficulty of interpreting the results. For example, the logarithm function turns multiplications to additions and powers to multiplications. Hence it turns divisions to subtractions and roots to divisions. Thus the geometric mean becomes the arithmetic mean and the ratio of geometric means becomes the difference between arithmetic means. Therefore reversing the transformation implies that a confidence interval for the difference between the means of the transformed data becomes a confidence interval for the ratio of the geometric means of the two groups of raw data.\nAlthough a transformation may lead to symmetry it may be better to consider other approaches. For example, plotting the data may show that there are at least two subgroups in the data. Transformations do not really solve the problem and we may have to subdivide the data into groups.\nNote that there are several other transformation functions available. For example, transformations such as arcsine are useful for proportion data."

In addition to the curve the plot contains a 95% confidence interval for the transformation parameter \\(\\lambda\\). The two vertical dotted lines are the endpoints of the confidence interval for \\(\\lambda\\). In this case the width of the confidence interval is quite small. The wider the confidence interval, the less obvious the choice for \\(\\lambda\\). If the confidence interval contains 1, then there is no need to perform a transformation. Note that the Box-Cox transformation is a normalising transformation. The EDA done in the previous sections relate to symmetry in the data.\nThe Box-Cox method, and other power transformations, should only be applied if the data are strictly positive. If all the data are negative one can of course take the absolute value of the data and then apply the transformation. If, however, only some of the data are not positive, we may add a constant to all of the data (to make the data positive) but the estimated power will vary depending on the constant."

    "text": "Ranking and rank Correlation\nA nonparametric approach used very frequently, especially in the social sciences, is the Spearman’s Rank Correlation. To calculate it, first rank the \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) variable, and then obtain usual correlation (the so-called Pearson correlation) coefficient. If there are a great many ties in the ranks then various corrections or modifications to the Spearman method have been suggested, but these are beyond the scope of this course. In principle then, one could simply apply the usual data analysis techniques to the \\(W= \\text {rank}(Y)\\) data and quote the \\(p\\)-values accordingly. We don’t usually do this in simple analyses, for reasons outlined below, but let’s explore this idea for a moment. Figure 16 shows the usual Pearson (lower diagonal) and Spearman rank correlations (upper diagonal) for the trees default R dataset.\n\n\nCode\nggpairs(\n  trees, \n  upper = list(continuous = wrap('cor', method = \"spearman\")), \n  lower = list(continuous = 'cor')\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Comparison of Pearson and Spearman rank correlations\n\n\n\n\nIt can be noted that the size of the estimates differ depending on the skew and relationship between the variables. For large samples it would be quite a reasonable approach, as the distribution of \\(W\\) values is symmetrical and therefore the usual data analysis methods - relying on \\(W\\) being Normally distributed - will work pretty well. The main difference to standard hypothesis tests would be that they would need to be expressed in terms of medians, say, rather than means.\nFor example, a two-group hypothesis test would be based on computing \\(W\\) for all the \\(n\\) data values together, and then comparing the mean of the \\(n_1\\) ranks in the first group of observations to the mean of the \\(n_2\\) ranks for the second group of observations. If there is no difference in population medians for the two groups, then we should not be able to reject the hypothesis that the mean \\(W\\) values are the same.\nIn practice there are a couple of complications. One is that for small samples the distribution of \\(W=\\text {rank}(Y)\\) is not Normal because it is discrete, taking only integers or averages of integers. But fortunately mathematical statisticians have long since worked out the exact distribution of \\(W\\) for many simple situations including two-sample tests, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA with balanced numbers, correlation coefficients (e.g. the correlation between \\(\\text {rank}(Y)\\) and \\(\\text {rank}(X)\\)) and some others. So these exact distributions can be used for hypothesis tests, and are available. The second complication is that these exact distributions for \\(W= \\text {rank}(Y)\\) usually depend on the assumption of no ties, i.e. no equal ranks. Since ties do often occur in practice (if only because data are not measured exactly enough) then we need to use methods that are modified or corrected to handle ties. Fortunately the use of a software handles such issues as a matter of course in many cases, so it doesn’t take any extra time or effort on our behalf."

So why not sample from the sample (i.e. resample) so that the quality of how well the sample is representative can be examined. We cannot gain extra information hugely by ordinary resampling and it is more like moving forward pulling the bootstrap! The methodology bootstrapping or resampling was introduced by Efron (1979). This computational intensive procedure can be implemented very mechanically and simpler. By computing the sampling distribution of a statistic of interest, issues such as its bias and the standard error can be addressed.\nR package boot has many features and several variations (types) of the bootstrap resampling method but harder to use. We will use the resample package instead because it is simpler and also includes simple permutation tests.\nUnder the simple bootstrap method, observations are resampled with replacement from the original sample to create a bootstrap sample. We can then compute a statistic such as the sample mean for this resample. This process can be repeated many times, say 10000, and we form the bootstrap distribution of the statistic. Consider the tv dataset. If we resample TELETIME, and compute the mean television viewing time for each sample, we construct the bootstrap distribution of mean. Using the resample package, we get-\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(resample)\nbootC &lt;- bootstrap(tv$TELETIME, mean)\nbootC\n\n\nCall:\nbootstrap(data = tv$TELETIME, statistic = mean)\nReplications: 10000\n\nSummary Statistics:\n     Observed       SE     Mean   Bias\nmean 1729.283 82.67234 1729.723 0.4401\n\n\nThis output shows the observed sample mean 1729.283 and the mean of all bootstrap means which is 1729.114. The bias is the difference, which is -0.168. The main advantage of the bootstrap method is that it can quantify the bias that can occur due to sampling.

See the testsmarks data example given below:\n\n\nCode\ndiffer &lt;- testmarks$Maths-testmarks$English\nbootC &lt;- bootstrap(differ, mean)\nCI.t(bootC)\n\n\n          2.5%    97.5%\nmean -4.188955 4.938955\n\n\nThe parametric (i.e. t-test based) and bootstrap results are very similar. The bootstrap method can obtain better confidence intervals for the mean when the population is skewed because resampling tends to adjust for the skew in the population when captured by the sample well. The bootstrap approach will work well only when reasonably large sample sizes are available because of the inherent uncertainty in the tails of the underlying distribution. Small samples are not sufficient to identify capture the tails of the distribution and hence certain types of inferences involving tail part of distribution will not work well. Parametric assumptions can be made to improve the bootstrap method and this approach is known as parametric bootstrapping. We will not study such methods in this course.\nThe resample package also has options to bootstrap from two vectors. Consider the television viewing times for the boys and girls groupings. We resample from the two groups to perform the two sample test.\n\n\nCode\nbootC &lt;- bootstrap2(tv$TELETIME, statistic=mean, treatment=tv$SEX)\nCI.t(bootC)\n\n\n               2.5%    97.5%\nmean: 1-2 -475.6394 231.5525\n\n\nThe bootstrap test conclusion again agrees with the Welch two-sample t-test conclusion.\nYou will not be examined on the use of permutation and bootstrap tests in the final exam. We may occasionally use this approach for assignments."

    "text": "Displaying & Interpreting the Fitted Model\nIt is fairly easy to display fitted simple regression line on a scatter plot; see Figure 2 and the R codes shown below:\n\n\nCode\nggplot(horsehearts) +\n  aes(x=EXTDIA, y=WEIGHT) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Simple regression line\n\n\n\n\nThe geoms geom_smooth() or stat_smooth() add the fitted regression line to the plot. For the simple regression of WEIGHT (weights of horses’ hearts) on EXTDIA (diastole exterior width), the fitted simple regression model is \\(\\hat{y}=a+bx\\) For horses heart data, the coefficient estimates are obtained as \\(a\\) = -2.0003 and \\(b\\) = 0.2996. That is, the fitted model is given by \\(fitted~~weight = -2.0003 + 0.2996\\times extdia\\) or after rounding\n\\[fitted~~weight = -2 +0.3\\times extdia\\]\nFor a given extdia \\(\\left(x\\right)\\) value, the expected weight is given by the fitted simple regression equation. For example, the exterior width (during diastole phase) for the \\(39^{th}\\) horse is 15.0mm and fitted weight is therefore\n\\[fitted~~weight =\\hat{y}_{39} = -2 + 0.3 \\times 15 = 2.5\\]\nThe observed weight of its heart \\(\\left(y_{39} \\right)\\) is 4.1kg. For this horse, we obtain the residual as\n\\[e_{39}= \\left(y_{39}-\\hat{y}_{39} \\right) = 4.1- 2.5 = 1.6.\\]\n\\(t\\)-test for Model Parameters\nIt is desirable to use the R package broom to get parts of the regression outputs. The function tidy() extracts the model and the significance testing results; see Table 1.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\nsimplereg &lt;- lm(WEIGHT~EXTDIA, data=horsehearts)\n\ntidy(simplereg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: t-tests for model parameters\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-2.00034\n0.55881\n-3.57965\n0.00085\n\n\nEXTDIA\n0.29963\n0.03877\n7.72793\n0.00000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the horses hearts data, under the null hypothesis that the true (or population) slope \\(b\\) equals zero (i.e., \\(H_{0}:\\beta =0\\)), the test statistic becomes\n\\[\nt=\\frac{b}{s_{b} } =\\frac{0.29963}{0.03877} = 7.728\n\\]\nThe \\(t\\)-statistic is clearly large enough to be considered significant for \\((n-2)\\) \\(df\\) and the \\(p\\)-value is close to zero. Thus, we would reject the null hypothesis \\(H_{0} :\\beta =0\\). In other words, the slope coefficient is significantly different from zero and hence the predictor variable extdia explains a significant amount of variation in the response variable weight.\nWe can also carry out a similar \\(t\\)-test for the \\(y\\)-intercept \\(\\alpha\\) based on the \\(t\\)-statistic:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{a}{s_a} = \\frac{-2.00034}{0.55881} = -3.58\n\\]\nbut the main interest is in the slope parameter \\(\\beta\\).

    "section": "Model Summaries",
    "text": "Model Summaries\nMany of the model summary measures can be obtained for assessing the quality of the fitted model using the glance() function from the broom package (Table 2).\n\n\nCode\nsimplereg |&gt; \n  glance() |&gt; \n  select(r.squared, sigma, statistic, p.value, AIC, BIC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Model summary measures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr.squared\n0.58\n\n\nsigma\n0.74\n\n\nstatistic\n59.72\n\n\np.value\n0.00\n\n\nAIC\n106.83\n\n\nBIC\n112.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to interpret entries appearing in the R output Table 2 is explained below. Note that the \\(R^{2}\\) statistic and the residual standard error are two common summary measures for the fitted model. The other measures such as the AIC and BIC shown in in Table 2 are useful for comparison of models, and selecting a best model, which will be discussed later on.\nResidual standard error\nThe size of the residual standard error \\(s_{e}\\), which is called sigma in Table 2, is important for many reasons. In general, we prefer to have \\(s_{e}\\) no more than 5% of \\(\\bar{y}\\) or small compared the range of \\(y\\) data. For the model fitted to horses hearts , the residual standard error is labelled as sigma in Table 2. This value of is rather large (compared to the range of \\(y\\) data), and hence the fitted model may not be good for prediction purposes.\nThe size of \\(s_{e}\\) also controls the size of the standard error of the slope estimate \\(b\\) (and hence its confidence interval).\nR-squared \\(\\left(R^{2} \\right)\\) statistic:\nThe R-Squared statistic, the proportion of the variation explained by the fitted model, is 0.58. This means that 58 percent of the total variation of the weights is explained by the exterior widths (diastole) using the fitted straight line model namely\n\\[\\text {fitted  weight = -2 +0.3}\\times \\text {extdia}\\]\nThe \\(R^{2}\\) value is also known as the coefficient of (multiple) determination. Notice that when there is only one explanatory variable \\(X\\), then the \\(R^{2}\\) is equal to the square of the \\((X,Y)\\) correlation coefficient, i.e. \\(R^{2} =\\left(r_{x,y} \\right)^{2}\\).\nWe usually require that \\(R^{2}\\) be at least 0.5 so that at least half of the variation is explained by the fit. For the Horse data the model \\(R^{2}\\) is not much better than this. However the scatterplot revealed that there may be two different groups of observations in the data and/or the curvature in the data may indicate that a transformation would be advisable so this low \\(R^{2}\\) is not really surprising.\nRemember that there is a difference between a meaningful model and a statistically significant model. An \\(R^{2}\\) of 0.5 or more indicates a meaningful model whereas the \\(t\\)-test for slope indicates a statistically significant model. A statistically significant model may not always be a meaningful model - in this case the significance is high but the \\(R^{2}\\) of 57.6% is barely adequate.\nANOVA and \\(F\\)-test\nTable 2 gives the F-statistic (labelled as just statistic) and the P-value for this F-statistic. The concept behind this statistic is explained below:\nThe variation in a data set can be measured as the sum of the squared deviation from its central value. This Sum of Squares is abbreviated as SS or SumSq in software regression outputs. For a regression model, we have\nI : total SumSq = variation in the observed values about the mean = \\(\\sum \\left(y-\\bar{y}\\right)^{2}\\).\nII : regression SumSq = Variation in the fitted values about the mean = \\(\\sum \\left(\\hat{y}-\\bar{y}\\right)^{2}\\) (Note that fit is denoted by \\(\\hat{y}\\)).\nIII : error or residual SumSq = Variation in the residuals \\(=\\sum \\left(y-\\hat{y}\\right)^{2} =\\sum e^{2}\\).\nThese sums of squares due to regression, error and total etc are usually displayed in the form of a table known as the analysis of variance table, which is usually shortened to ANOVA or anova. A typical ANOVA table for a simple regression model will appear as in Figure 3. Depending on the package used, the ANOVA table may differ slightly in style.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A typical ANOVA table\n\n\nR does not print the last row while displaying the F-statistic and ANOVA table. The following codes can be used to obtain the ANOVA output for the regression model (Table 3).\n\n\nCode\nsimplereg |&gt; anova()\n\n# or \n\nsimplereg |&gt; anova() |&gt; tidy()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Analysis of Variance Table\n\n\nterm\ndf\nsumsq\nmeansq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nEXTDIA\n1\n32.731\n32.731\n59.721\n0\n\n\nResiduals\n44\n24.115\n0.548\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach sum of squares (source of variation) has associated with it a degrees of freedom \\(df\\)). For one explanatory variable, the regression \\(df\\) = 1. The total \\(df\\) is always one less than the sample size, that is \\(n-1.\\) In other words, residual \\(df\\) = \\(n-2\\). From the sums of squares, the variance estimates are calculated as SumSq/df which are called Mean Squares (MeanSq).\nFor the horses’ heart data, we have Regression SumSq = 32.731, Error SumSq= 24.115 and Total SumSq = 56.845. We also have regression \\(df\\) = 1, total \\(df\\) = \\(n-1 = 45\\) and by subtraction residual \\(df= 45-1= 44\\). Dividing the SumSq by the associated \\(df\\), we compute\n\nRegression Mean Sq = 32.731/1 = 32.731\n\nResidual Mean Sq = 24.115/44 = 0.548\n\nTotal Mean Sq = Total SumSq/45 = \\(\\sum(y-\\bar{y})^2/(n-1)=1.263\\)\n\nNote that the Total Mean Sq is nothing but the variance of \\(y\\), which is usually not displayed in the ANOVA table.\nIt is possible to formalise the goodness of fit of the model by carrying out an \\(F\\)-test. The \\(F\\) statistic is formed by the ratio of two estimates of variances, the regression Mean Sq or variance and the error Mean Sq or variance. The distribution of the \\(F\\) statistic is governed by the numerator \\(df\\) and the denominator \\(df\\). For the horses’ heart data, we obtain\n\\[F =\n\\frac{{\\text {regression MeanSq} }}{{\\text {residual MeanSq}}}\n= \\frac{32.731}{0.548} = 59.721 \\]\nwith 1 \\(df\\) for the numerator and 44 \\(df\\) for the denominator.\nThe null hypothesis is that the model does not fit the data well. That is, the model explains too little of the variation in the \\(y\\) values to be significant. This hypothesis is generally rejected whenever the \\(p\\)-value of the \\(F\\)-test is less than 0.05. In ANOVA table, the \\(F\\) statistic is displayed along with the \\(p\\)-value. Here the \\(p\\)-value is the probability of observing an \\(F\\) statistic larger than the computed value. For horses’ heart data, the computed \\(F\\) statistic is 59.721. \\(F\\) statistic is always positive (being the ratio of mean squares) and hence the alternative hypothesis must be one-sided. That is, the \\(p\\)-value is given by \\(\\Pr \\left(F_{1,44} &gt;59.721\\right)\\) which is very close to zero. This means that the null hypothesis is firmly rejected and we conclude that the regression model using the explanatory variable extdia explains a significantly large proportion of the variation of the response variable weight.\nNote that the \\(R^{2}\\) can also be calculated from the ANOVA table\n\\[R^{2} =\\frac{{\\text {regression SumSq}}}{{\\text {total SumSq}}} = \\frac{32.731}{56.845} = 0.5758\\] or alternatively\n\\[R^{2} = 1-\\frac{{\\text {residual SumSq}}}{{\\text {total SumSq}}} = 1 -- \\frac{24.115}{56.845} = 0.5758.\\] The degrees of freedom for residual SumSq and total SumSq are not identical; while they are very close this is not always the case (e.g. in multiple regression which we will meet in the next chapter). Hence we can adjust for this to obtain the adjusted R-Squared (\\(R_{adj}^{2}\\)):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nR_{adj}^{2}\n&= 1-\\frac{\\left(\\frac{{\\text {residual SumSq}}}{{\\text {residual df}}} \\right)}{\\left(\\frac{{\\text {totalSumSq}}}{{\\text {total df}}} \\right)\\, } \\\\\n&= 1-\\frac{24.115/44}{56.845/45} \\\\\n&=0.5661.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nFor the simple regression, the \\(F\\)-test is equivalent to the previous \\(t\\)-test (and produces exactly the same \\(p\\)-value). In fact when there is only one explanatory variable the two test statistics are related by the equation \\(F\\) = \\(t^2\\). A further relationship between the two is that the residual standard error is the square root of the residual mean square.\nThe summary() function in base R gives rather a bulky output for the fitted regression model particularly when the number of predictors is large.\n\n\nCode\nsimplereg &lt;- lm(WEIGHT~EXTDIA, data=horsehearts) \nsummary(simplereg)\n\n\nThe R package lessR will get you even a bigger output of model quality and summary measures.

For example, we could argue that the weight of the heart should be closely related to the volume of the heart and volume is related to the product of three lengths or any one length cubed. Rather than cubing the \\(X\\) variable we usually transform the response variable \\(Y\\). Alternatively we might choose a transformation based on statistical grounds. Our previous discussion suggests that a shrinking transformation should be used, so suppose we take the logarithm of \\(Y\\). The distribution of weights is compared before and after transformation in Figure 13.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Comparison of raw and log-transformed Weight data\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the effect of logarithmic transformation from the boxplot in Figure 13. Clearly the distribution has become more symmetric. In order to make the distribution even more symmetric we might also try a power transformation as shown in Figure 13. Here we have applied the negative reciprocal cubic root transformation \\(-\\frac {1}{Y^{1/3}}\\) which makes more physical sense. This yields a slightly symmetric distribution. A minimal summary output of the regression of \\(WEIGHT^{1/3}\\) on EXTDIA is shown in Table 4:\n\n\nCode\nlm(WEIGHT^(1/3)~EXTDIA, data=horsehearts) |&gt; \n  glance() |&gt; \n  select(r.squared, sigma, statistic, p.value, AIC, BIC)|&gt; \n  mutate_if(is.numeric, round,3) |&gt; \n  t() |&gt; \n  kable() |&gt; \n  kable_classic(full_width = F) \n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Cubic Root Transformed Response Model Summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr.squared\n0.616\n\n\nsigma\n0.128\n\n\nstatistic\n70.498\n\n\np.value\n0.000\n\n\nAIC\n-54.588\n\n\nBIC\n-49.102\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis output shows an improvement in the \\(R^{2}\\) value. However, for technical reasons one cannot meaningfully compare \\(R^{2}\\) values for the raw and transformed data. The estimated standard deviation of the residuals is also meaningless when comparing raw and transformed data (recall that this quantity is the square root of the residual MeanSq). There is really only one way to confirm whether a transformed model is better than the original model and that is by analysing the residuals. Only if the residuals are better behaved, in that they comply more closely with the regression assumptions, can one claim that the transformed model is preferable. This is a very important point.\nIn the next Chapter, we will cover more on AIC and BIC values shown in@tbl-transweightreg but the simple thumb rule is to opt a model with the smallest AIC or BIC while we go for a model with the largest log-likelihood.\nThese values also support the model based on the negative reciprocal cubic root transformed data.\n(c) Add other explanatory variables to the model\nThis will cause the \\(R^{2}\\) to increase (although we may decide that the increase is not worth the effect of making the model more complicated). We will study multiple regression models having two or more predictors in the next chapter."

    "text": "Cross Validation (CV)\nThis technique is commonly employed for validating models for prediction purposes. The available data is split randomly into \\(k\\) (equal) folds (parts), often by resampling. A model is fitted for the \\((k-1)\\) folds of the data, and then the prediction errors are calculated for the fold that was omitted for modelling. This process can be repeated omitting one subset (out of the \\(k\\) subsets) so that all the \\(k\\) subsets contribute to the estimation of prediction accuracy. This exercise is computationally intensive, and hence we will leave it to the software package such as caret, rsample or modelr to perform the cross validation. Consider the simple regression of WEIGHT on EXTDIA done with the horsesheart data. The following R code perform the 5-fold cross validation of the model for prediction purposes and compare the root mean square errors for both the regression and robust regression models.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(MASS, exclude = \"select\")\n\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Set up cross validation\nfitControl &lt;- trainControl(method = \"repeatedcv\", \n                           number = 5, \n                           repeats = 100)\n\n# lmfit\nlmfit &lt;-  train(WEIGHT ~ EXTDIA,\n                data = horsehearts, \n                trControl = fitControl, \n                method = \"lm\")\n\n# rlmfit\nrlmfit &lt;- train(WEIGHT ~ EXTDIA, \n                data = horsehearts, \n                trControl = fitControl, \n                method = \"rlm\")\n\n# Extract the RMSE scores\ndfm &lt;- tibble(\n  lm = lmfit |&gt; pluck(\"resample\") |&gt; pull(RMSE),\n  rlm = rlmfit |&gt; pluck(\"resample\") |&gt; pull(RMSE)\n) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols=everything(),\n               names_to = \"Method\",\n               values_to = \"RMSE\")\n  \n# Make plot of RMSE\nggplot(dfm) +\n  aes(x=Method, y=RMSE, col = Method) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  coord_flip() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Comparison of Residual Mean Square Error (RMSE) of lm() vs rlm() fits\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20 shows that the robust rlm() fit slightly outperforms the simple regression fit in terms of RMSE.

For example, with \\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\) variables, Area 3 is identified when \\(I_1 = I_2 = 0\\).\nLet us regress the pine tree Top circumference on the indicator variables \\(I_2\\) and \\(I_3\\) using the following R codes.\n\n\nCode\npinetree1 &lt;- pinetree |&gt; \n  select(Area, Top) |&gt; \n  mutate(I1 = as.numeric(Area == \"1\"),\n         I2 = as.numeric(Area == \"2\"), \n         I3 = as.numeric(Area == \"3\") )\n\nmdl &lt;- lm(Top ~ I2 + I3, data = pinetree1)\n\nlibrary(broom)\n\ntidy(mdl)\n\n\n\n\nCode\npinetree1 &lt;- pinetree |&gt; \n  select(Top, Area) |&gt; \n  mutate(I1 = as.numeric(Area == \"1\"),\n         I2 = as.numeric(Area == \"2\"), \n         I3 = as.numeric(Area == \"3\") )\n\nmdl &lt;- lm(Top ~ I2 + I3, data = pinetree1)\n\ntidy(mdl)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Regression of Top Circumference on Area Indicator Variables\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n20.025\n1.11375\n17.979805\n0.0000000\n\n\nI2\n-1.955\n1.57508\n-1.241207\n0.2196132\n\n\nI3\n-5.925\n1.57508\n-3.761714\n0.0004002\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following points are to be noted on the regression model shown in Table 4:\n\nThe \\(y\\)-intercept 20.025 is the mean Top circumference for Area 1 (i.e. the mean response for the omitted predictor category).\nThe mean Top circumference 2 and 3 can be found from the fitted model. For Area 2, \\(I_1\\) =0, \\(I_2\\)=1, and \\(I_3\\) =0. Substituting these values in the fitted model, we get \\(20.025 -1.955 \\times 1 -5.925 \\times 0 = 20.025-1.955 = 18.07\\), which is mean Top circumference for Area 1. For Area 3, the mean Top circumference for Area 3 is \\(20.025 -1.955 \\times 0 -5.925 \\times 1 = 20.025= 14.1\\). In other words, the fitted coefficient of an indicator variable is the difference between the response means of the category indicated by the variable and the ‘base’ category (indicated by the omitted indicator variable).\nThe significance of the slope coefficients implies a significant difference in means. For example, the coefficient of the indicator variable \\(I_2\\) is highly significant. This means that the mean Top circumference for Area 2 is significantly different from the mean Top circumference for Area 1. The negative sign of the coefficient means that Area 2 mean is significantly lower when compared Area 1 mean. The same is true when Area 3 is compared with Area 1.\nIn the above output, a multiple comparison of means is made keeping Area 1 as the base. A comparison of the mean Top circumference for Areas 2 & 3 is not possible with the above regression. We need to omit either \\(I_2\\) or \\(I_3\\) and fit a regression for such a comparison.\n\nIn practice, you will NOT be creating any indicator variables to perform the analysis and R does it for us when we use the lm() function but we have to make sure that categorical factors are stored as factors, not numerical variables.\nThe ANOVA of the regression model shown in Table 5 has a highly significant F value which means that at least one Area is different in terms of mean Top circumference.\n\n\nCode\nlm(Top ~ Area, data=pinetree) |&gt; anova()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Regression ANOVA\n\n\n\nDf\nSum Sq\nMean Sq\nF value\nPr(&gt;F)\n\n\n\n\nArea\n2\n364.5903\n182.29517\n7.348015\n0.0014482\n\n\nResiduals\n57\n1414.0995\n24.80876\nNA\nNA"

The semantics of pipes is taking the output from the left-hand side and passing it as input to the right-hand side.\n\n\nThe R package magrittr introduced the pipe operator %&gt;% and can be pronounced as “then”. In RStudio windows/Linux versions, press Ctrl+Shift+M to insert the pipe operator. On a Mac, use Cmd+Shift+M.\nR also has its own pipe, |&gt;, which is an alternative to %&gt;%. I tend to use |&gt;. If you want to change the pipe inserted automatically with Ctrl+Shift+M, find on the menu Tools &gt; Global Options, then click on Code and check the box that says “Use Native Pipe Operator”.\nWe often pipe the dplyr functions, and the advantage is that we show the flow of data manipulation and subsequent graphing.

The principles of tidy data are:\n\nEach variable forms a column.\nEach observation forms a row.\nEach type of observational unit forms a table.\n\nThe hospital admissions dataset is untidy because it does allocate many columns for a variable.\n\n\nCode\nmy.data &lt;- read.table(\n  \"https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/hospital.txt\",\n  header=TRUE, sep=\",\")\n  \nhead(my.data)\n\n\n  YEAR PERI NORTH1 NORTH2 NORTH3 SOUTH1 SOUTH2 SOUTH3\n1 1980    1      0      4     27      4     16     27\n2 1980    2      6     11     31      8     18     21\n3 1980    3      6      4     25     20     16     24\n4 1980    4      1     10     31     22     17     20\n5 1980    5      4     16     22     21     30     31\n6 1980    6      3      8     28     31     20     30\n\n\nThe main response variable namely the number of admissions is allocated different columns depending on the North and South locations. This format is also called wide format which can be made into a tidy long format. Try-\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nmy.data |&gt; \n  gather(NORTH1, NORTH2, NORTH3, \n         SOUTH1, SOUTH2, SOUTH3)\n\n\nThe command spread() does the opposite to gather(). The tidyr package many other functions such as unite(), separate() etc to deal with columns. A better approach would be to use the dplyr function pivot_longer(). Try-\n\n\nCode\nmy.data |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(cols = NORTH1:SOUTH3, \n               names_to = \"location\", \n               values_to = \"Admissions\")\n\n\nThe command pivot_wider() does the opposite to pivot_longer()\nThe dplyr package also has functions to deal with two-tables which can be joined either conditionally or unconditionally using commands such as full_join(). For a detailed notes and examples, you may visit https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html but we will be using such functions very occasionally in this course.\nThe reshape2 and data.table packages also have functions to do the same task."

    "text": "Data Quality Checks\nIt is a good idea to check the quality of secondary data sourced from elsewhere. For example, there could be missing values in the dataset. Consider the Telomeres data downloaded from http://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/rsos192136_si_001.xlsx\n\n\nCode\n# #| eval: false\n# url &lt;- \"http://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/rsos192136_si_001.xlsx\"\n# destfile &lt;- \"rsos192136_si_001.xlsx\"\n# # \n# download.file(url, destfile)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nurl &lt;- \"http://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/rsos192136_si_001.xlsx\"\ndestfile &lt;- \"rsos192136_si_001.xlsx\"\n\ncurl::curl_download(url, destfile)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\nrsos192136_si_001 &lt;- read_excel(\"rsos192136_si_001.xlsx\")\n\n\nThe missingness of data can be quickly explored using many R packages. The downloaded Telomeres dataset contain many missing values.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(VIM)\n\n\nLoading required package: colorspace\n\n\nLoading required package: grid\n\n\nVIM is ready to use.\n\n\nSuggestions and bug-reports can be submitted at: https://github.com/statistikat/VIM/issues\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'VIM'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:datasets':\n\n    sleep\n\n\nCode\nres &lt;- rsos192136_si_001 |&gt; \n  aggr(sortVar=TRUE) |&gt; \n  summary() |&gt; \n  pluck(\"combinations\")\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(naniar)\ngg_miss_var(rsos192136_si_001) \n\n\nThe term Missing completely at random (MCAR) is often used to mean there is there is no pattern to the missing data themselves or alternatively the missingness is not related to any other variable or data in the dataset. In other words, the probability of missingness is the same for all units. So no bias is caused by the missing data, and we can discard cases with missing data when we fit models.\nIn practice, we often find missing data do have a relationship with other variables in the dataset but the actual missing values are random. This situation of data conditionally missing at random is called Missing at random (MAR) data. For a particular survey question, the response rate may differ depending on the respondent’s gender. In this situation, the actual missingness may be random but still related to the gender variable.\nMissing not at random (MNAR) is the pattern when missingness is related to other variables in the dataset, as well as the values of the missing data are not random. In other words, there is a predictable pattern in the missingness. So we cannot avoid the bias when missing cases are omitted.\nThere are also situations such as censoring where we just record a single value without actually measuring the variable of interest.\nImputation of data can be made except for the case of MCAR type. A number of R packages are available for data imputation; see https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MissingData.html or https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/. We may occasionally cover data imputation issue in an assignment question.\nThere are also R packages to perform automatic investigation for data cleaning. Try-\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dataMaid)\n\nmakeDataReport(rsos192136_si_001, output=\"html\", replace=TRUE)\n\n# or\nlibrary(DataExplorer)\n\ncreate_report(rsos192136_si_001)\n\n\nRule based validation is enabled in the R package validate. The R package janitor has a function get_dupes() to find duplicate entries in the dataset. Cleaner package will allow to clean the variables so that the columns are consistent in terms of the factor, date, numerical variable types. You will be largely using data that are already cleaned for your assignments but be aware that you have to perform data cleaning and perform necessary quality checks before analysis."

K-S differs from Shapiro-Wilk in that you specify the mean and SD of the distribution. Let’s say someone made the claim that prestige was normally distributed with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 17. We can test this like so:\n\n\nCode\nks.test(Prestige$prestige, \"pnorm\", 50, 17)\n\n\nWe reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence against this claim.\nAt any rate, I don’t believe in “true” distributions. Would I feel comfortable assuming that these data came from a normal distribution? Possibly. It all depends on the context. Remember, there are no true models, only useful ones.\nLet’s see if the square root-transformed prestige looks normal.\n\n\nCode\nshapiro.test(sqrt(Prestige$prestige))\n\n\nNo significant departure from normality for the sqrt-transformed data."

DNA is a double stranded helix made up of four different nucleotides. These nucleotides differ in which of the four bases Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), or Thymine (T) they contain. Nucleotides combine to form amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins. Simply put, three nucleotides form an amino acid and the specific order of a combination dictates what amino acid is formed. A simple pattern that we may want to detect in a DNA sequence is that of the nucleotide at position i+1 based on the nucleotide at position i. The nucleotide positional data collected by a researcher in a particular case is given in the following table:\n\n\n\ni\\(i+1)\nA\nC\nG\nT\n\n\n\n\nA\n622\n316\n328\n536\n\n\nC\n428\n262\n204\n306\n\n\nG\n354\n294\n174\n266\n\n\nT\n396\n330\n382\n648\n\n\n\nPerform a test of association and then obtain the symmetric plot.\n\n\nCode\ntabledata &lt;- data.frame(\n  A = c(622, 428, 354, 396),\n  C = c(316, 262, 294, 330),\n  G = c(328, 204, 174, 382),\n  T = c(536, 306, 266, 648), \n  row.names = c(\"A\", \"C\", \"G\", \"T\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nchisq.test(tabledata)$exp\n\n\n         A        C        G        T\nA 554.8409 370.5104 335.3705 541.2781\nC 369.4834 246.7328 223.3322 360.4516\nG 334.9983 223.7044 202.4879 326.8094\nT 540.6774 361.0523 326.8094 527.4608\n\n\nCode\nchisq.test(tabledata)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  tabledata\nX-squared = 153.21, df = 9, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nCode\nchisq.test(tabledata, simulate.p.value = T)\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test with simulated p-value (based on 2000\n    replicates)\n\ndata:  tabledata\nX-squared = 153.21, df = NA, p-value = 0.0004998\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# if there is an association we can examine patterns \nlibrary(MASS)\ncorresp(tabledata)\n\n\nFirst canonical correlation(s): 0.1443355 \n\n Row scores:\n         A          C          G          T \n-0.1921802 -0.8894387 -1.0334109  1.4453224 \n\n Column scores:\n         A          C          G          T \n-1.1304512 -0.6952989  0.8139424  1.1304056 \n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot(corresp(tabledata, nf=2))\nabline(v=0)\nabline(h=0)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#or\nlibrary(FactoMineR)\nCA(tabledata)\n\n\n**Results of the Correspondence Analysis (CA)**\nThe row variable has  4  categories; the column variable has 4 categories\nThe chi square of independence between the two variables is equal to 153.2146 (p-value =  1.902013e-28 ).\n*The results are available in the following objects:\n\n   name              description                   \n1  \"$eig\"            \"eigenvalues\"                 \n2  \"$col\"            \"results for the columns\"     \n3  \"$col$coord\"      \"coord. for the columns\"      \n4  \"$col$cos2\"       \"cos2 for the columns\"        \n5  \"$col$contrib\"    \"contributions of the columns\"\n6  \"$row\"            \"results for the rows\"        \n7  \"$row$coord\"      \"coord. for the rows\"         \n8  \"$row$cos2\"       \"cos2 for the rows\"           \n9  \"$row$contrib\"    \"contributions of the rows\"   \n10 \"$call\"           \"summary called parameters\"   \n11 \"$call$marge.col\" \"weights of the columns\"      \n12 \"$call$marge.row\" \"weights of the rows\"         \n\n\n\nMore R code examples are here"

Let’s break it down.\n\nThe Call part shows us the command we used to produce the model.\nThe Residuals part gives us a five-number summary of the residuals.\nThe Coefficients table provides the estimates of the model parameters. Specifically, the Estimate column gives us the estimates of the \\(\\beta\\)-coefficients, which can be used to reconstruct the predictive formula. Here, that formula is:\n\\[\\hat y = -1.6311 + 0.2321 × INNERSYS + 0.5195 × INNERDIA + ... + 0.3387 × EXTDIA\\]\nThe Std. Error column gives the standard error for the estimates of the coefficients. That is, the expected average deviation of the estimator of the coefficient (\\(b\\) or \\(\\hat \\beta\\)) from the true population parameter (\\(\\beta\\)). If we were to take many samples (of size \\(n\\)) from this population, a coefficient’s standard error represents how much the estimate is expected to vary (due to sampling variation).\nThe t value is the estimate divided by its standard error, which can be used to test whether the effect of that variable is statistically different from zero. The p-value for this test is provided in the next column, headed Pr(&gt;|t|). If the p-value is low, the observed coefficient estimate is unlikely to have resulted by chance due to sampling variation if the null hypothesis (\\(H_0 : \\beta = 0\\)) is true. Asterisks indicate significant results, as coded by the Signif. codes: given below the table.\nThe final three lines give results for the entire model.\nThe final three lines give results for the entire model.\nThe Residual standard error is an estimate of the standard deviation of the residuals, i.e. the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. When estimating the weight of horse’s hearts using this model, we would expect to, on average, be wrong by 0.6 kg. The degrees of freedom here are the residual degrees of freedom—the number of independent pieces of information with which the residual standard error was estimated.\nNext, we have the Multiple R-squared, which is the proportion of the total variation in y that is explained by the model. Here, 75% of the variation is explained. The Adjusted R-squared is adjusted for the number of variables included in the model (see lecture slides). It cannot be interpreted in same way as the unadjusted \\(R^2\\) can, but it can be used to compare models.\nFinally, an F-statistic, associated degrees of freedom (DF) , and p-value are provided. This tests whether the model explains a significant proportion of the total variation in y. This can be thought of as testing whether any of the \\(\\beta\\) coefficients in model are non-zero. Here, the p-value is very small so we reject the null hypothesis that all of the \\(\\beta\\) coefficients in model are zero."

A consequence of multicollinearity is that it increases the uncertainty in the estimates of the coefficients—the standard errors of the coefficients are inflated.

The variables INNERDIA and OUTERSYS, though correlated (r = 0.77), do not exert undue influence on each other in the model.\nTo summarise, let’s see the AIC scores for all the models we’ve made so far.\n\n\nCode\nAIC(mf, m2, m3, mstep, mstep2, mstep3)\n\n\n       df      AIC\nmf      8 92.04262\nm2      7 90.70599\nm3      6 90.18764\nmstep   6 90.18764\nmstep2  5 92.14759\nmstep3  4 90.45888\n\n\nAll of these models have very similar AIC. Statisticians say that AIC scores within, say, 3 points can be considered equivalent, and so often we take the approach of choosing the simplest model (i.e. that with the fewest predictors) of all those within 3 AIC points of the lowest score. In some fields it is common to report all models within 10 AIC points or produce an ensemble model bases on AIC weight (not covered in this course). So, while the mstep3 model isn’t the absolute lowest, it is the simplest model from a bunch of models with roughly equivalent AIC scores. Also, it is a good choice because it doesn’t have the problems with severe multicollinearity found in the other models.\nDon’t worry about the fact that the two functions drop1() and AIC() give different scores. Remember the AIC is a tool for comparing models—the actual scores don’t matter. If you look at the difference in AIC scores between two models from the two functions, they are the same. It also should not be compared on models that have different data sources because it is unit less and only acts to compare the models in a specific set.\nDifference between AIC scores for mstep2 and mstep3 from the drop1(mstep2) output:\n\n\nCode\n-40.395 - (-42.083)\n\n\n[1] 1.688\n\n\nAnd from the AIC(mf, m2, m3, mstep, mstep2, mstep3) output:\n\n\nCode\n92.14759 - 90.45888\n\n\n[1] 1.68871\n\n\nSo now we can choose mstep3 and clean up.\n\n\nCode\nrm(mf, m2, m3, mstep, mstep2) # this code removes these variables\n\n\nLet’s examine the summary for our chosen model.\n\n\nCode\nsummary(mstep3)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = WEIGHT ~ INNERDIA + OUTERSYS, data = hh)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1.08663 -0.33797 -0.08511  0.32755  1.82971 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept)  -1.4948     0.3728  -4.009 0.000238 ***\nINNERDIA      0.8797     0.2164   4.065 0.000201 ***\nOUTERSYS      0.5612     0.1901   2.952 0.005100 ** \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 0.6133 on 43 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.7155,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.7023 \nF-statistic: 54.07 on 2 and 43 DF,  p-value: 1.833e-12\n\n\nWe are now explaining 72% of the variation in heart weights with two variables, as opposed to 75% of the variation with six variables in the original full model. Note also that, in the full model, INNERDIA was not significant and OUTERSYS was only weakly significant. In the smaller model, both these predictors were highly significant. Personally, I would definitely prefer the more parsimonious two-variable model, especially if it meant that I had only to take two, rather than six, ultrasound measurements on a thousand horses!\nBut we’re not done yet. We must use some diagnostic tools to examine whether our model meets the assumptions of linear regression before we can accept it."
