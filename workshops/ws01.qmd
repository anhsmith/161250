# Installing R and RStudio {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-tip}

You are NOT expected to become an expert in R programming or required to be one for doing this course.

Feel free to post your queries regarding R and RStudio on the class Stream discussion forum.

:::


R <https://www.r-project.org/> is an open-source (i.e., free) software
package. This software is available for essentially all computing
platforms (e.g. Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac) is maintained and developed
by an energetic community of users including many of the world's
foremost statisticians.

R is also a programming language but you may not be required to do a lot
of programming for your course work. R includes functions which enables
us to perform a full range of statistical analyses.

**For installing R software, please visit
<https://cran.stat.auckland.ac.nz/> and follow the instructions.**

Note that the R software will be sitting in the background in RStudio
and you will not be using it directly for this course.

RStudio <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/> is an integrated
development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console,
syntax-highlighting editor (as well as to quickly jump to R function
definitions) that supports direct R code execution. It also contains
tools for plotting, history, debugging, workspace and project
management. RStudio has many other features such as authoring HTML, PDF,
Word Documents, and slide shows. In order to download RStudio (Desktop
edition, open source), go to

<https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>

Download the installation file and run it. **Note that RStudio must be
installed after installing R.**

R/RStudio can also be used using the cloud platform at
<https://rstudio.cloud/> after creating a *free* account but
occasionally some of the packages covered in this course may fail to
work in the cloud platform.

If you open RStudio, you will see something similar to the screen shot
shown in @fig-rstud:

![An RStudio window](img/Rstudio.png){#fig-rstud}

RStudio has many options, such as uploading files to a server, creating
documents etc. You will be using only a few of the options. You will
*not* be using the menus such as *Build*, *Debug*, *Profile* at all in
this course.

You can either type or copy and paste the R codes appearing in this
section on to the R Script window and run them.

## Some `R` basics {.unnumbered}

-   `R` is case sensitive, so `data` is not the same as `DATA`

-   `<-` (read as "gets") is the assignment operator. That is, you use
    `<-` to assign some content to a variable. The operator `=` has a
    slightly different meaning but it can be used in the same way as `<-`. In R Studio, press `ALT` and minus key when you are in the R script mode
    (File \>\> New File \>\> R Script).

-   Comments are denoted by the \# symbol. Anything after a `#` symbol
    is ignored by `R` .

-   R coding can be hard to write from scratch. 
    `r colorize("So do not hesitate to adopt R codes written by others.", "red")`
    Search the internet for R code to do what you want to do. The usual `copy and paste` trick works!

*Working directory*

In RStudio, set the working directory under the *Session* menu. It is a
good idea to start your analysis as a new project in the File menu so
that the entire work and data files can be saved and re-opened easily
later on.

*R/RStudio as a calculator*

*In RStudio, use the File \>\> New File \>\> R Script menu to type or
copy and paste the commands and execute them*

Type `1+1` to see `2` on the console (or `->Run` the code in RStudio).

```{r}
1+1
```

Type `a=1;b=2;a/b` to see `0.5`.

```{r}
a=1;b=2;a/b
```

Note that semicolon separates various commands. It is optional to use
them as long as you type the commands one by one as follows:

```{r}
a=1
b=2
a/b
```

There are many built-in functions. Try the following.

`27^3` `sqrt(10)` `round(sqrt(10),2)` `abs(-4)` `log(10)` `exp(10)`
`rnorm(100)` `mean(rnorm(100))` `sd(rnorm(100))`

You may wonder what was the base used for `log(10)`. A help on this can
be obtained by placing a question mark (`?`) before log as `?log` or by

**help(log)**

There are a few exceptions. The command `?if` wont work but `?"if"`
will. In other words, `?"log"` or `help("log")` are safer ways of
getting help on "built-in" functions.

`r colorize("In RStudio, use the R Editor (menu *File > New Script*) to type the commands and submit them (shortcut: *CNTRL+R*). ", "red")`

*Default examples*

The command `example()` will produce the available HELP examples, and
will work for most functions. For example, try `example(boxplot)`. You
will see many boxplot examples such as the following:

```{r}
boxplot(count ~ spray, data = InsectSprays, col = "lightgray")
```

There are also demos available, explore using the command `demo()`. The
basic R system produces somewhat old style graphs.

[So we will be largely using the newer plotting system **ggplot** which
is part of the `tidyverse` suite of packages; see
<https://www.tidyverse.org/>.]{style="color: red;"} 

Let's load that package now:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

A huge number of other dedicated packages are available to improve the
power of R. Many R packages are hosted at a repository called CRAN
(*C*omprehensive *R* *A*rchive *N*etwork). The package install option
within RStudio can download and install these optional packages under
the menu `Packages >> Install`. You can also do this using the command
`install.packages`. For example

`install.packages("tidyverse", "car"), dependencies = TRUE)`

This command installs two packages `tidyverse` and `car` in one go.

Contributed R packages are grouped in various headings at
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/>. They can be installed in bulk
using the `ctv` package command `install.views()`.

You might have to install quite a few packages as you work through this course.

## Loading/Importing Data {.unnumbered}

Most data sets we shall consider in this course are in a tabular form.
This means that each variable is a column, each row is an observation,
columns are separated by white space (or comma), and each column or row
may have a name. If a data set of this form is stored in a plain ASCII
text file, then we can import this file using the `Import Dataset`option
in RStudio.

![](img/rstudioimport.jpg)


As an exercise, try importing the Telomeres data file (in Excel format)
available at

<https://rs.figshare.com/ndownloader/files/22850096>

Note that Excel files usually contain blanks for missing or unreported
data or allocate many rows for variable description, which can cause
issues while importing them.

SQLite is a public-domain, light-weight database engine (https://sqlite.org/about.html). The R package `RSQLite` will import *.sqlite files. Databases are usually large in size, and hence R packages such as `dbplyr` can be used package to query a database.

Existing `*.RData` files can be added to the RStudio Environment for
further analysis just by double clicking.

We will be mainly using RStudio menus for loading the data or use R
commands to load the data for assignments.

## Graphing with `ggplot2` {.unnumbered}

The R library `ggplot2` is very powerful for plotting but
`r colorize("you may find the syntax little strange.", "red")` There are
plenty of examples at the [ggplot2 online help
website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/). The `ggplot2` package is loaded as part of the `tidyverse` set of packages.

Advantages of ggplot2 are the following:

-   employs the `grammar of graphics` of [@Wilkinson]
-   plotting involves a high level of abstraction
-   very flexible and complete graphics system
-   theme system for getting attractive plots
-   Fast growing and actively developed

Some disadvantages of `ggplot2` are the following:

-   3-dimensional graphics (opt for `rgl` package instead)
-   Graph-theory type graphs (nodes/edges layout; opt for `igraph` and
    other packages)
-   Interactive graphics (opt for `plotly`, `ggvis` and other packages)

`Grammar of Graphics`

The main idea behind the grammar of graphics of [@Wilkinson] is to mimic
the manual graphing approach and define building blocks and combine them
to create a graphical display. The building blocks of a graph are:

-   data
-   aesthetic mapping
-   geometric object
-   transformation or re-expression of data
-   scales
-   coordinate system
-   position adjustments
-   faceting

If have not installed `ggplot2` or `tidyverse`, install it with the
following commands.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

We can now load the ggplot2 library with the commands:

```{r, warninng=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

In order to work with ggplot2, we must have a `data frame` or a `tibble`
containing our data. We need to specify the `aesthetics` or how the
columns of our data frame can be translated into positions, colours,
sizes, and shapes of graphical elements.

The geometric objects and aesthetics of the ggplot2 system are explained
below:

*Aesthetic Mapping* (`aes`)

In ggplot land *aesthetic* means visualisation features or aesthetics.
These are

-   position (i.e., on the x and y axes)
-   color ("outside" color)
-   fill ("inside" color)
-   shape (of points)
-   linetype
-   size

Aesthetic mappings are set with the `aes()` function.

*Geometric Objects* (`geom`)

Geometric objects or `geoms` are the actual marking or inking on a plot
such as:

-   points (`geom_point`, for scatter plots, dot plots, etc)
-   lines (`geom_line`, for time series, trend lines, etc)
-   boxplot (`geom_boxplot`, for boxplots)

*A plot must have at least one `geom` but there is no upper limit.* In
order to add a `geom` to a plot, the `+` operator is employed. A list of
available geometric objects can be obtained by typing `geom_<tab>` in
Rstudio. The following command can also be used which will open a Help
window.

    help.search("geom_", package = "ggplot2")

Consider the study guide dataset `rangitikei.txt` (Recreational Use of
the Rangitikei river). The first 10 rows of this dataset are shown
below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
my.data <- read.csv(
  "https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/rangitikei.csv", 
  header=TRUE
  )

head(my.data, 10)
```

The description of the variables is given below:

`loc` - two locations were surveyed, coded 1, 2\
`time` - time of day, 1 for morning, 2 for afternoon\
`w.e` - coded 1 for weekend, 2 for weekday\
`cl`- cloud cover, 1 for \>50%, 2 for \<50%\
`wind`- coded 1 through 4 for increasing wind speed\
`temp` - temperature, 1, 2 or 3 increasing temp\
`river`- murkiness of river in 3 increasing categories\
`people` - number of people at that location and time\
`vehicle`- number of vehicles at that location at that time\

This dataset is downloaded from the web using the following commands.

```{r}
my.data <- read.csv(
  "https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/rangitikei.csv", 
  header=TRUE
  )
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = my.data,
       mapping = aes(x = vehicle, y = people)
       ) +
  geom_point()
```

The `aes` part defines the "aesthetics", which is how columns of the dataframe map to graphical attributes such as x and y position, colour, size, etc. An aesthetic can be either numeric or categorical and an appropriate scale will be used. After this, we add layers of graphics. `geom_point` layer is employed to map x and y and we need not specify all the options for `geom_point`.

The `aes()` can be specified within the `ggplot` function or as its own separate function. I prefer this format. 

```{r}
ggplot(my.data) +
  aes(x = vehicle, y = people) +
  geom_point()
```


We can add a title using *labs()* or *ggtitle()* functions. Try-

```{r, fig.show="hide"}
ggplot(my.data) +
  aes(x = vehicle, y = people) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("No. of people vs No. of vehicles")
```

or

```{r, fig.show="hide"}
ggplot(my.data)+
  aes(x = vehicle, y = people) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "No. of people vs No. of vehicles")
```

Note that *labs()* allows captions and subtitles.

`geom_smooth` is additionally used to show trends.

```{r}
ggplot(my.data) +
  aes(x = vehicle, y = people) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```

Similar to `geom_smooth`, a variety of `geoms` are available.

```{r}
ggplot(my.data) + 
  aes(x = factor(wind), y = people) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Each `geom` accepts a particular set of mappings;for example
`geom_text()` accepts a `labels` mapping. Try-

```{r, fig.show="hide"}
ggplot(my.data) +
  aes(x = vehicle, y = people) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label = w.e), 
            size = 5)
```

The faceting option allows a collection of small plots with the same
scales. Try-

```{r}
ggplot(my.data) +
  aes(x=vehicle, y=people) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ river) 
```

Faceting is the `ggplot2` option to create separate graphs for subsets
of data. `ggplot2` offers two functions for creating small multiples:

1. `facet_wrap()`: define subsets as the levels of a single grouping variable
2. `facet_grid()`: define subsets as the crossing of two grouping variables

The following arguments are common to most scales in ggplot2:

-   **name:** the first argument gives the axis or legend title
-   **limits:** the minimum and maximum of the scale
-   **breaks:** the points along the scale where labels should appear
-   **labels:** the labels that appear at each break

Specific scale functions may have additional arguments. Some of the
available Scales are:

| **Scale**         | **Examples**              |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| `scale_color_`    | `scale_color_discrete`    |
| `scale_fill_`     | `scale_fill_continuous`   |
| `scale_size_`     | `scale_size_manual`       |
|                   | `scale_size_discrete`     |
|                   |                           |
| `scale_shape_`    | `scale_shape_discrete`    |
|                   | `scale_shape_manual`      |
| `scale_linetype_` | `scale_linetype_discrete` |
|                   |                           |
| `scale_x_`        | `scale_x_continuous`      |
|                   | `scale_x_log`             |
|                   | `scale_x_date`            |
| `scale_y_`        | `scale_y_reverse`         |
|                   | `scale_y_discrete`        |
|                   | `scale_y_datetime`        |

In RStudio, we can type `scale_` followed by TAB to get the whole list
of available scales.

Try-

```{r}
ggplot(my.data) + 
  aes(x = vehicle, y = people, color = factor(temp)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(name = "No. of Vehicles") + 
  scale_y_continuous(name = "No. of people") + 
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Temperature")

```

The other coding option is shown below:

```{r, fig.show = 'hide'}
ggplot(my.data) +
  aes(x = vehicle, y = people, color = factor(temp)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  xlab("No. of Vehicles") + 
  ylab("No. of people") + 
  labs(colour="Temperature") 
```

Note that a desired graph can be obtained in more than one way.

The `ggplot2` theme system handles plot elements (not data based) such
as

-   Axis labels
-   Plot background
-   Facet label background
-   Legend appearance

Built-in themes include:

-   `theme_gray()` (default)
-   `theme_bw()`
-   `theme_minimal()`
-   `theme_classic()`

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(my.data) + 
  aes(x = vehicle, y = people, color = factor(temp)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Note that the graph is assigned an object name `p1` and nothing will be
printed unless we then print the object `p1`.

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(my.data) + 
  aes(x = vehicle, y = people, color = factor(temp)) + 
  geom_point()

p1
```

Try-

```{r}
p1 + theme_light()
```

```{r}
p1 + theme_bw()
```

Specific theme elements can be overridden using `theme()`. For example:

```{r}
p1 + theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(color = "red"))
```

All theme options can be seen with `?theme`.

To specify a theme for a whole document, use

```{r}
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

*Minimal graphing* can be done using the `qplot` option that will
produce a few standard formatted graphs quickly.

```{r}
qplot(people, vehicle, data = my.data, colour = river)
```

Try-

`qplot(people, data = my.data)`

`qplot(people, fill=factor(river), data=my.data)`

`qplot(people, data = my.data, geom = "dotplot")`

`qplot(factor(river), people, data = my.data, geom = "boxplot")`

A cheat sheet for `ggplot2` is available at
<https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/> (optional to download).
There are many other packages which incorporate ggplot2 based graphs or
dependent on it.

The library *patchwork* allows complex composition arbitrary plots,
which are not produced using the faceting option. Try

```{r}
library(patchwork)

p1 <- qplot(people, data = my.data, geom = "dotplot")
p2 <- qplot(people, data = my.data, geom = "boxplot")
p3 <- ggplot(my.data, aes(x = vehicle, y = people)) + geom_point()

(p1 + p2) / p3 + 
  plot_annotation("My title", caption = "My caption")
```

## `ggplot` builder {.unnumbered}

A nice R package, known as `esquisse` is available to build few simple
ggplot graphics interactively. This may help in the early stages of
learning to use ggplot graphing.

If this package is not installed, installed it first & then try.

    library(esquisse)
    options("esquisse.display.mode" = "browser")
    esquisse::esquisser(data = iris)

You can also load the desired dataset within `R` studio and select the
dataset.

The other option is to load a dataset from the course data web folder
and then launch `esquisse`. Try-

    url1 <- "https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/rangitikei.RData"
    download.file(url = url1, destfile = "rangitikei.RData")
    load("rangitikei.RData")
    esquisse::esquisser(data = rangitikei, viewer = "browser")

You can also download the associated R codes or save the graph within
the `esquisse` web app.

## `tidyverse` and related packages {.unnumbered}

In the recent years, `tidyverse` suite of packages, which includes
`ggplot2` has become the popular tool for data handling and plotting. In
this section, a brief intro to the data management packages such as
`dplyr` is given.

For detailed coverage of the `tidyverse` system, go to
<https://www.tidyverse.org/>.

### `dplyr` {.unnumbered}

The following six functions of `dplyr` are very useful for data
wrangling :

-   For selecting columns, use `select()`
-   For subsetting data, use `filter()`
-   For re-ordering (e.g. ascending/descending), use `arrange()`
-   For augmenting new calculated columns, use `mutate()`
-   For computing summary measures, use `summarise()`
-   For group-wise computations (e.g. summary measures), use
    `group_by()`

There are many other functions such as `transmute()` which will add
newly calculated columns to the existing data frame but drop all unused
columns. The `across()` function  extends `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions for multiple column and function summaries.  For example, you like to report rounded data in a table, which calls for an operation across both rows and columns.

> ##### **Piping operation is a fundamental aspect of computer programming. The semantics of pipes is taking the output from the left-hand side and passing it as input to the right-hand side.**

The `R` package `magrittr` introduced the pipe operator `%>%` and can be
pronounced as "then". In RStudio windows/Linux versions, press
`Ctrl+Shift+M` to insert the pipe operator. In Mac, use `Cmd+Shift+M`. 

`R` also has its own pipe, `|>`, which is an alternative to `%>%`. I tend to use `|>`. If you want to change the pipe inserted automatically with `Ctrl+Shift+M`, find on the menu **Tools > Global Options**, then click on **Code** and check the box that says "**Use Native Pipe Operator**". 

We often pipe the `dplyr` functions, and the advantage is that we show
the flow of data manipulation and subsequent graphing. This approach
also helps to save memory, and dataframes are not unnecessarily created,
a necessity for a big data framework.

Try the following examples after loading the `rangitikei` dataset.

`select()`

```{r}
my.data <- read.csv("https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/rangitikei.csv", header=TRUE)

names(my.data)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

new.data <- my.data |> 
  select(people, vehicle)

names(new.data)
```

```{r}
my.data |> 
  select(people, vehicle) |> 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x=people, y=vehicle) +
  geom_point()
```

We select two columns and create a scatter plot with the above commands.

`filter()`

```{r}
my.data |> 
  filter(wind==1) |> 
  select(people, vehicle) |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x=people, y=vehicle) +
  geom_point()
```

The above commands filter the data for the low wind days and plots
vehicle against people.

`arrange()`

```{r}
my.data |> 
  filter(wind==1) |> 
  arrange(w.e) |> 
  select(w.e, people, vehicle)
```

`mutate()`

Assume that a \$10 levy is collected for each vehicle. We can create
this new `levy` column as follows.

```{r}
my.data |> 
  mutate(levy = vehicle*10) |> 
  select(people, levy) |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = people, y=levy) +
  geom_point()
```

Note that the pipe operation was used to create a scatter plot using the
newly created column.

`summarise()`

```{r}
my.data |> 
  summarise(total = n(), 
            avg = mean(people)
            )
```

We obtain the selected summary measures namely the total and the mean
number of people. Try-

```{r}
my.data |> 
  filter(wind == 1) |> 
  summarise(total = n(), 
            avg = mean(people)
            )
```

`group_by()`

We obtain the wind group-wise summaries below:

```{r}
my.data |> 
  group_by(wind) |> 
  summarise(total=n(), 
            avg=mean(people))
```

There are many more commands such as the `transmute` function which
conserves the only the needed columns. Try

```{r}
my.data |> 
  group_by(wind, w.e) |> 
  transmute(total=n(), 
            avg=mean(people))
```

A simple frequency table is found using `count()`. Try-

```{r}
my.data |> 
  group_by(wind, w.e) |> 
  count(temp)

my.data |> 
  group_by(wind, w.e) |> 
  count(temp, river)
```

The `count()` is useful to check the balanced nature of the data when
many subgroups are involved.

### `tidyr` {.unnumbered}

By the phrase `tidy data`, it is meant the preferred way of arranging
data that is easy to analyse. The principles of tidy data are:

-   Each variable forms a column.
-   Each observation forms a row.
-   Each type of observational unit forms a table.

The hospital admissions dataset is untidy because it does allocate many
columns for a variable.

```{r}
my.data <- read.table(
  "https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/hospital.txt",
  header=TRUE, sep=",")
  
head(my.data)
```

The main response variable namely the number of admissions is allocated different columns depending on the North and South locations. This format is also called `wide format` which can be made into a tidy `long format`. Try-

```{r}
#| results: hide
library(tidyr)

my.data |> 
  gather(NORTH1, NORTH2, NORTH3, 
         SOUTH1, SOUTH2, SOUTH3)
```

   

The command `spread()` does the opposite to `gather()`. The `tidyr`
package many other functions such as `unite()`, `separate()` etc to deal with columns. A better approach would be to use the `dplyr` function `pivot_longer()`. Try-

```{r}
#| results: hide

my.data |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = NORTH1:SOUTH3, 
               names_to = "location", 
               values_to = "Admissions")
```




The command `pivot_wider()` does the opposite to `pivot_longer()`

The `dplyr` package also has functions to deal with two-tables which can be joined either conditionally or unconditionally using commands such as `full_join()`. For a detailed notes and examples, you may visit <https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html> but we will be using such functions very occasionally in this course.

The `reshape2` and `data.table` packages also have functions to do the same task.

## A typical data analysis session in R/RStudio {.unnumbered}

A data analysis session in R/RStudio involves loading the data,
graphing, and modelling. You finally save your outputs or produce a

When you begin your analysis in RStudio, start it as a new project in the File menu. You can save all your work in one go when you quit the RStudio software. You can always load your project later on to continue the analysis.

For the sack of simplicity, let us use an R default dataset called
`stackloss` giving the operational data of a plant for the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.

```{r}
data("stackloss")
head(stackloss, 5)
```

The distribution of the response variable `stack.loss` is explored using
a histogram below:

```{r}
stackloss |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(stack.loss) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 5)
```

Histograms are not good displays for small datasets. In order to see the
size or length of `stack.loss` data, we select the stack.loss variable
and then summarise the size using the *n()* option.

```{r}
stackloss |> 
  select(stack.loss) |> 
  summarise(n())
```

The following commands will also work.

```{r}
length(stackloss$stack.loss)

stackloss |> pull(stack.loss) |> length()
```

We may also explore how well `stack.loss` is related `Air.Flow` to using
a scatter plot. For this, we type the command `plot`

```{r}
stackloss |> 
  ggplot() +
  aes(y=stack.loss, x=Air.Flow) +
  geom_point()
```

The relationship is roughly linear. So we may fit a straight line model
using the `lm` command.

```{r}
st.line.model <- lm(stack.loss~Air.Flow, data=stackloss)
```

We can query this model asking for its summary using the `summary()`
function.

```{r}
summary(st.line.model)
```

`R` default model summary is bit too long.  We may just glance the overall quality measures of the fitted model as follows:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(kableExtra)

out1 <- st.line.model |> 
  glance() |> 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), 
                ~round(., 2))
         )

out1 |> t() |> kable() |> 
  kable_classic(full_width = F) 
```

For processing using Rmarkdown, we may use the codes which will give a tidy tabular output in the word-processed output.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(kableExtra)

out1 <- st.line.model |> 
  tidy() |> 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 2)))

kable(out1) |>  
  kable_classic(full_width = F) 
```

The fitted model is shown below:

```{r}
ggplot(stackloss) + 
  aes(y=stack.loss, x=Air.Flow) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE)
```

The fitted model can also be displayed on the scatter plot using the old style `plot` and `abline` commands.

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.show="hide"}
plot(stack.loss ~ Air.Flow, data=stackloss)
st.line.model <- lm(stack.loss~Air.Flow, data=stackloss)
abline(st.line.model)
```

### Data Quality Checks {.unnumbered}

It is a good idea to check the quality of secondary data sourced from
elsewhere. For example, there could be missing values in the dataset.
Consider the Telomeres data downloaded from
<http://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/rsos192136_si_001.xlsx>

```{r}
#| eval: false
url <- "http://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/rsos192136_si_001.xlsx"
destfile <- "rsos192136_si_001.xlsx"

download.file(url, destfile)
```

```{r}
library(readxl)
rsos192136_si_001 <- read_excel("rsos192136_si_001.xlsx")
```

The missingness of data can be quickly explored using many R packages.
The downloaded Telomeres dataset contain many missing values.

```{r, results='hide'}
library(VIM)

res <- rsos192136_si_001 |> 
  aggr(sortVar=TRUE) |> 
  summary() |> 
  pluck("combinations")
```

or

```{r, fig.show='hide', results='hide'}
library(naniar)
gg_miss_var(rsos192136_si_001) 
```

The term *Missing completely at random* (MCAR) is often used to mean
there is there is no pattern to the missing data themselves or
alternatively the missingness is not related to any other variable or
data in the dataset. In other words, the probability of missingness is
the same for all units. So no bias is caused by the missing data, and we
can discard cases with missing data when we fit models.

In practice, we often find missing data do have a relationship with
other variables in the dataset but the actual missing values are random.
This situation of data conditionally missing at random is called
*Missing at random (MAR)* data. For a particular survey question, the
response rate may differ depending on the respondent's gender. In this
situation, the actual missingness may be random but still related to the
gender variable.

*Missing not at random (MNAR)* is the pattern when missingness is
related to other variables in the dataset, as well as the values of the
missing data are not random. In other words, there is a predictable
pattern in the missingness. So we cannot avoid the bias when missing
cases are omitted.

There are also situations such as censoring where we just record a
single value without actually measuring the variable of interest.

Imputation of data can be made except for the case of MCAR type. A
number of R packages are available for data imputation; see
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MissingData.html> or
<https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/>. We may occasionally cover data
imputation issue in an assignment question.

There are also R packages to perform automatic investigation for data
cleaning. Try-

```{r}
#| results: hide
#| eval: false

library(dataMaid)

makeDataReport(rsos192136_si_001, output="html", replace=TRUE)

# or
library(DataExplorer)

create_report(rsos192136_si_001)

```


Rule based validation is enabled in the R package *validate*. The R
package *janitor* has a function get\_dupes() to find duplicate entries
in the dataset. *Cleaner* package will allow to clean the variables so
that the columns are consistent in terms of the factor, date, numerical
variable types. You will be largely using data that are already cleaned
for your assignments but be aware that you have to perform data cleaning
and perform necessary quality checks before analysis.

## R default (base) Graphing {.unnumbered}

For a simple bar chart, try

```{r, fig.show="hide"}
freq <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
names <- c("A","B","C","D","E")
barplot(freq, names.arg=names)
```

Let us generate random data from the normal distribution *N(10,1)*
distribution and form a batch of data for illustrating graphing in R.
Try the following commands one by one.

```{r}
#| results: hide

x  <-  rnorm(40, 10,1)

hist(x)

boxplot(x)

plot(x)

plot(density(x), xlab="")

stripchart(round(x,1), method = "stack", pch=20)

plot(ecdf(x), verticals=TRUE)

```




We can form a matrix of order 3X2 or (or 2X3) and display all the above
six graphs in a panel. This is done using the option `par()`, which
controls the graphics *par*ameters.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5}
x  <- rnorm(40, 10,1)

par(mfrow = c(2, 3))

hist(x) 

boxplot(x)

plot(x)

plot(density(x), xlab='')

stripchart(round(x,1), method = "stack", pch=20)

plot(ecdf(x), verticals=TRUE)

```

Although we shall not cover them here, many plotting options can be set using `par()` function; including size of margins, font types, the colour of axis labels etc. See `help("par")`. The option `par(new=T)` will be useful for an overlaid graph (instead of splitting a graph). Try the following:

```{r, fig.show="hide"}
x  <- rnorm(40, 10,1)

plot(x, type = "o", pch = 1, ylab = "", 
     ylim = c(6.5, 13.5), lty = 1)

par(new=T)

y  <-  rnorm(40, 10,1)

plot(y, type = "o", pch = 2,
     ylab = "Two Batches of Random Normal Data",
     ylim = c(6.5, 13.5), lty = 2)
```

Note that `pch` specifies for the plotting character and `lty` specifies
the line type. You can add a legend by the following command line:

`legend("topright", c("Batch I", "Batch II"), pch=1:2, lty=1:2)`

For scatter and other related plots, the command is `plot()`. Try

```{r, fig.show="hide"}
x  <-  rnorm(40, 10,1)
y  <- rnorm(40, 10,1)
plot(y~x)  # or plot(x,y) 
```

Add a title by the command

`title("This is my title")`

Add a reference line for the mean at the x-axis by the command

`abline(v=10)`

and again with `abline(h=10)` for the y-axis. A 45 degree (Y=X) line can be added by the command

`abline(0,1) #slope, b=1, y-intercept a=1`

You may also specify two points on the graph, and ask them to be
connected using the command

`lines(c(8, 12), c(8, 12), lty=2, col=4, lwd=2)`

Note that the `line()` has extra arguments to control the line type,
line width, and colour.

The command `rug(x)` draws will draw small vertical lines on the x-axis (the command actually suits better for one dimensional graphs such as a boxplot). Try

`rug(x)`

`rug(y, side=2)  #side =2 specifies y-axis`

Graphs can be saved in various file formats, such as PDF (.pdf), JPEG (.jpeg or .jpg), or postscript (.ps), by enclosing the plotting function in the appropriate commands. For example, to save a simple figure as a PDF file, we use the `pdf()` function.

`x  <-  1:10`

`y  <-  x^2`

`pdf(file = "Fig.pdf")`

`plot(x, y)`

`dev.off()`

The `command dev.off()` closes the file. You may use the copy and paste facility for processing graphs or use the RStudio option to save graphs.

The`lattice` package contains extra graphing facilities but such graphs can be produced using ggplot2 package. Try-

```{r}
my.data <-read.csv(
  "https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/tv.csv", 
  header=TRUE)

library(lattice)

bwplot(TELETIME ~ factor(SCHOOL), 
       data = my.data)
```

It requires a bit of coding to combine base, lattice and ggplot graphs. Try the following codes which combines three density plots of the same data produced in different styles.

```{r, fig.show="hide"}
library("grid")
library("ggplotify")

x= rnorm(30)

p1 <- as.grob(~plot(density(x)))
p1 <- as.ggplot(p1)

p2 <- as.grob(densityplot(x))
p2 <- as.ggplot(p2)

library(ggplot2)

p3 <- data.frame(x=x) |> 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x) +
  geom_density()

library(patchwork)

p1/(p2+p3)
```



::: {.callout-tip}

It is optional to work through the activities that follow to gain an appreciation of how R works. Do not try to remember how to do everything right now. For your assignment work, we will be given the R codes to load data, graphing and modelling. These codes will give you a head-start. Note that we often often learn R by doing and sometime making mistakes.

## R Objects, Model Syntax etc. {.unnumbered}

In R, we work with objects. There are different classes of objects
including: `character`, `integer`, `numeric`, `vector`, `matrix`,
`array`, `data.frame`, `list`, `lm` (linear model). An object may belong to several classes at once.

Suppose that your data consists of 4 numbers say 1 to 4. We can combine these numbers using the `c()` function namely `c(1,2,3,4)` and then assign it to `x`, an object.

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- c(1,2,3,4)
```

Alternatively, we can use the `scan()` function to enter the data
manually one by one. In practice we load/import data and these details are explained in the next section.

Evidently `x` is a vector and also belongs to other classes of objects. This can be queried as follows:

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
is(x)
```

The main class it belongs to is queried as

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
class(x)
```

Our data are actually integers and arranged in a pattern. So we can
define `x` as follows:

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- 1:4
```

The colon (`:`) operator created the desired pattern. Alternative
expressions include

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- seq(1, 4, by=1)
``` 

Try `is(x)` and `class(x)` and check whether our data are recognised as integer class.

We can do many mathematical manipulations on `x`. Try

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
mean(x)
min(x)
max(x)
sum(x)
sd(x)
var(x)
sort(x, T)
trunc(x/2)
```

Vector elements are accessed by square brackets, `[]`. Try

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x[2]+x[4]
x[2:3]
x[c(1,3)]
x[-2]
```

Assume that our data are actually categorical codes. Then the correct way of defining the character data is to use single quotes as

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
```

Now try Try `is(x)` and `class(x)`. For large patterned categorical
data, placing quotes is laborious. So we can change the class as
follows:

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- as.character(1:4)
```

Assume that you have two batches of data. The first one is

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- 1:4 
```

and the second one is

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
y <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
```

These two batches can be combined into a matrix as follows:

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
m <- cbind(x,y)
```

Here the matrix `m` is formed by binding the columns (vectors). The
other option is to bind as rows

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
m <- rbind(x,y)
```

Evidently vectors must be of the same length for these commands to work. We can also form a matrix by splitting a vector. Try

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- 1:6
m <- matrix(x, byrow = TRUE, ncol = 3)
m <- matrix(x, byrow = TRUE, ncol = 2)
```

and just type `m` to see the generated matrix on the R console.

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
m
```

To access the first of row of the matrix `m`, we use `m[1,]`; to access the first column of `m`, we use `m[,1]`.

A `data frame` is an R object that contains vectors; the vectors are
stored vertically in a matrix like structure, and can be referred to by the name of the column. The main advantage of a data frame is that the variables in a data frame do not all need to be the same type; e.g. some variables can be of class numeric, and some variables can be of class character. We can create a data frame object using the `data.frame()` function. This data frame contains two small vectors, the first of which is named `ID`, and the second `NAME`. Try 

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
x <- 1:4
y <- c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')
my.data <-data.frame(ID=x, NAME=y)
my.data 
```

We can access the original vector of interest in the following way:

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
my.data$NAME
```

or with `tidyverse`

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
my.data |> pull(NAME)
```


There are times when it is useful to convert a data frame into a matrix; we can do this with the `as.matrix()` function.

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
m <- as.matrix(my.data)
```

Type `class(m)` and see the changes.

Two data frames can also be merged into a single data frame using the `merge` command.

The internal structure of an R object can be viewed using the diagnostic function `str()`.

*Simple Manipulations*

There is always more than one-way of manipulating the data, producing summaries and tables from raw data.

One of the simplest manipulations on a batch of data we may do is to
change the data type say numeric to character. For example, the
television viewing time data in the text file `tv.csv` is read into a dataframe by the command line

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
my.data <- read.csv(
  "https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/tv.csv", 
  header =TRUE
  )
```

We can improve the `read.csv` command to recognise the data type while reading the table as follows, using the `read_csv` command from the `readr` package:

```{r}
my.data <- read_csv(
  "https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/tv.csv", 
  col_types = "nfcc"
  )
```

The argument `col_types = "nfcc"` stands for \{`numeric`, `factor`, `character`, `character`\}, to match the order of the columns.

```{r}
my.data
```

We often do a summary of a numerical variable for a given categorical variable. For example, we like to see obtain the summary statistics of TV viewing times for various schools. The commands

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
attach(my.data)
by(TELETIME, SCHOOL, summary)
```

We employed the `by()` command above and instead, we may also use
`tapply()` `aggregate()` functions:

`tapply(TELETIME, SCHOOL, summary)`

`aggregate(TELETIME, list(SCHOOL), summary)`

A tabulated summary of categorical data is obtained using the `table()`
command.

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
my.data <- read.csv(
  "https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/rangitikei.csv",
  header=TRUE
  )

wind <- my.data |> pull(wind)
river <- my.data |> pull(river)

table(wind, river)
```

It is sometimes convenient to work with matrices for some R functions
such as `apply()`. For example, the number of admissions data in
`hospital.txt` data can be formed as a matrix. Note that this is
possible because we have the same number of observations for each
hospital location.

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
data <- read.table(
  "https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/hospital.txt",
  header=TRUE, 
  sep=",")

M <- data |> 
  select(NORTH1, NORTH2, NORTH3, 
         SOUTH1, SOUTH2, SOUTH3) |> 
  sqrt()

means <- apply(M, 1, mean)
sds <- apply(M, 1, sd)

plot(means, sds)
```

*R default options for Hypothesis tests and modelling*

The `stats` default package in R has a number of functions for
performing hypothesis tests. However you will only use the following for
this course:

`ks.test` - Kolmogorov-Smirnov Tests

`shapiro.test` - Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test

`t.test` - Student's t-Test (one & two samples, paired t-test etc)

`pairwise.t.test` - Pairwise t tests (for multiple comparison)

`oneway.test` - Test for Equal Means in a One-Way Layout

`TukeyHSD` - To Compute Tukey's Honest Significant Differences

`var.test` - F Test to Compare Two Variances

`bartlett.test` - Bartlett Test of Homogeneity of Variances

`fisher.test` - Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data

`chisq.test` - Pearson's Chi-squared Test for Count Data

`cor.test` - Test for Association/Correlation Between Paired Samples

The `car` package is needed for the following:

`durbinWatsonTest ` Durbin-Watson Test for autocorrelated Errors

`leveneTest` Levene's Test

We will largely use the R function `lm` in this course. The syntax for specifying a model under `lm` command (and various other model related commands) is explained below:

The structure of the model is that the response variable is modelled as a function of the response variables. The symbol `~` (tilde) is used to say "a function of". The simple regression of `y` on `x` is therefore specified as

`lm(y ~ x)`

The same applies to a one-way ANOVA in which `x` is a categorical factor. For example, consider `tv.txt` dataset and the one-way ANOVA model of `TELETIME` for `SCHOOL` is specified as follows:

```{r, results='hide'}
mydata <- read.csv(
  "https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/tv.csv", 
  header=TRUE
  )

mymodel <- lm(TELETIME ~ factor(SCHOOL), 
              data = mydata) # replace lm by aov and try

summary(mymodel)
```

The function `summary()` gives the summary of the model (F statistics, residual SD etc). The model summary output can be stored into a text file using the function `sink()` or copy and paste in the windows version. Graphs associated with a model can be obtained using the command

`plot(mymodel)`

In the above context, we may also use the specific test command which will give the same result but this test can also be performed without assuming equal variances.

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
oneway.test(TELETIME ~ SCHOOL, 
            var.equal = TRUE, 
            data = mydata) 
```

For the `lm` command, note the following:

`+` indicates inclusion (not addition) of an explanatory variable in the model

`-` indicates deletion (not subtraction) of an explanatory variable from the model

`*` indicates the inclusion of the explanatory variables and their
interaction (not multiplication) between explanatory variables

`:` (colon) means only interaction between explanatory variables

`/` indicates the nesting (not division) of explanatory variables

`|` indicates the conditioning (for example `y ~ x|z` means that y is a function of x for given z).

For our course, you will not use the last two types. Some model examples are given below:

`lm(y ~ x + z)` \#regression of y on x and z (flat surface fit)

`lm(y ~ x*z)` \#includes the interaction term ie `lm(y ~ x + z + x:z)`

`lm(y ~ x + I(x^2)` \# fits a quadratic model or use `poly(x,2)`

`lm(log(y) ~ sqrt(x) + log(z))` \#all variables are transformed

As a further example, consider a study guide dataset. The following
commands fit a simple regression model and then plot the fitted line on a scatter plot. Note that commands can be shortened but deliberately shown this way.

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
mydata <- read.csv(
  "https://www.massey.ac.nz/~anhsmith/data/horsehearts.csv", 
  header=TRUE
  )

x <- mydata$EXTDIA
y <- mydata$WEIGHT

simplereg <- lm(y ~ x)
```

Note that our model object `simplereg` can be queried in many ways. The command `summary()` gives the following output.

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
summary(simplereg)
# or
# library(broom)
# tidy(simplereg)
# glance(simplereg)
```

The command `names(simplereg)` will gives the names of many individual components of the object `simplereg` we created. For example, a plot of the residuals against the fitted values can be obtained as

```{r, fig.show="hide", results='hide'}
plot(residuals(simplereg) ~ fitted.values(simplereg))
```
